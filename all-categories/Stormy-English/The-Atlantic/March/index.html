<p>Bridget Jones, as a character, has always hovered uncomfortably
between <em>==the hard light of reality and the rosy glow of
romance==</em> . When she first appeared, in newspaper columns written
by the British journalist Helen Fielding during the mid-1990s, the 30-
something Bridget was claimed as a <em>==totem==</em> of woman
<em>==hood==</em> at the time: a calorie-counting,
self-improvement-obsessed, chain-smoking, <em>==wine-guzzling
singleton==</em> (a <em>==neologism==</em> Fielding
<em>==immortalized==</em> ); an <em>==earnest==</em> <em>==vassal==</em>
of <em>Cosmo</em> culture and the embodiment of
<em>==fearmongering==</em> Newsweek coverage about the plight of
unmarried career girls. With Bridget, Fielding “articulated the traumas
of a generation,” the writer Alain de Botton observed.</p>
<p>But when Bridget’s diary <em>==entries==</em> were published in book
form, in 1996, her true narrative <em>==arc==</em> was revealed. It
didn’t chart a postmodern Gen X nightmare. It was lovingly
<em>==cribbed==</em> from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. The most
notorious single woman of an era, as her fans learned in the book and
its 1999 <em>==sequel==</em> , and from the movies they inspired in 2001
and 2004, would be largely protected by the <em>==tired==</em> old
<em>==trappings==</em> of the marriage plot: She would <em>==bag==</em>
her Mr. Darcy and live happily ever after—with a few
<em>==detours==</em> —in his <em>==dreamy==</em> <em>==detached==</em>
house in Holland Park.</p>
<p>Her <em>==trajectory==</em> over the next decade-plus (in another
round of newspaper columns; another book; and a third movie, Bridget
Jones’s Baby, in 2016, not based on a book) certainly had its
<em>==requisite==</em> <em>==stumbles==</em> . But the character was
<em>==steadied==</em> throughout by the <em>==Texan==</em> actor Renée
Zellweger as the very English Bridget, an unpredictably brilliant piece
of <em>==casting==</em> that just works.</p>
<p>On paper, Bridget can be <em>==compellingly==</em> hard to <em>==pin
down==</em> , <em>==inconstant==</em> and <em>==ironic==</em> ,
<em>==messily self-aware==</em> , undeniably human. Early on, she
<em>==cops==</em> to highly compromised feminist principles: She will
not “ <em>==sulk==</em> about having no boyfriend, but develop inner
<em>==poise==</em> and authority and sense of self as woman of
substance, complete <em>without</em> boyfriend, as best way to obtain
boyfriend.” On-screen, though, Zellweger makes her all heart,
<em>==guileless==</em> as a <em>==toddler==</em> , impossibly hopeful
and <em>==lovably==</em> absurd. Whatever cards she’s dealt—not least
professional <em>==humiliation==</em> and an accidental pregnancy
(paternity unclear, thanks to separate one-night stands and a box of
expired <em>==eco-friendly condoms==</em> )—she <em>==muddles==</em>
through with <em>==gusto==</em> . We know that Bridget will get her
happy ending; this is just about the last romantic-comedy
<em>==franchise==</em> standing. But Zellweger makes us also deeply want
her to win, formulaic predictability be damned.</p>
<p><em>Bridget Jones</em>: Mad About the Boy, an adaptation of the
<em>==slapdash==</em> third novel that starts <em>==streaming==</em> on
Peacock on February 13, keeps the <em>==trope-laden structure==</em> ,
but finds surprising depth in a devastating plot twist. Bridget, now in
her 50s, is single once again: Her beloved husband, Mark Darcy (played
in grand <em>==metafictional==</em> form by an actor who played the
other Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth), has died while on a
<em>==humanitarian==</em> mission in Sudan, leaving Bridget to raise
their two children alone. The book uses Mark’s death mostly as a
narrative device to launch Bridget, with her typically obsessive energy,
into <em>==cougardom==</em> : She starts dating a <em>==hunky==</em> man
in his late 20s named— <em>==inanely==</em> —Roxster, which exposes
Bridget to a whole new range of body-image issues, and exposes Roxster
to her children’s head <em>==lice==</em> .</p>
<p>The movie, though, is more interested in documenting Bridget’s loss,
and in the process, it presents a more honest and moving version of her
than we’ve seen before. <em>How will the last cockeyed optimist in
popular culture deal with such desolation?</em> <em>==Widowhood==</em>
is no laughing matter, parenting alone even less so—though we have to
laugh at Bridget burying her face in the <em>==fridge==</em> to curse,
and being surprised by her son’s <em>==uptight==</em> science teacher
while buying an astonishing variety of <em>==contraceptives==</em> .
<em>==Pathos==</em> <em>==underpins==</em> the plot. “Do you miss Dada
sometimes?” Mabel, Bridget’s daughter, asks her in the movie. “I miss
him all of the times,” Bridget replies.</p>
<p><em>==Grief==</em> is a tough sell for a <em>==rom-com==</em> , which
is maybe why the movie has marketed itself as something more timely,
once again positioning Bridget as representative of her moment. Cinema
lately has been consumed with what viewers call the “ <em>==age-gap
romance==</em> ,” or, less <em>==decorously==</em> , the “MILF setup.”
In 2024’s <em>The Idea of You</em>, Anne Hathaway plays a
<em>divorcée</em> not unlike Bridget in her <em>==ditziness==</em> , who
<em>==careens==</em> her way into a love affair with a handsome British
<em>==boy-bander==</em> . In two separate movie projects within the
space of a year, <em>A Family Affair</em> and <em>Babygirl</em>, Nicole
Kidman <em>==parses==</em> the power differentials at play when older
women find <em>==fulfillment==</em> with younger men.</p>
<p>Bridget’s adventures with the age gap are characteristically sweet
and <em>==laced==</em> with <em>==goofiness==</em> : When she meets
Roxster, she’s shinnying up a tree that both of her children have
managed to get stuck in. When he later messages her on Tinder, it’s via
an account that her friends have set up: “Tragic Widow Seeks Sexual
Awakening.” <em>==Mortification==</em> , for Bridget, is only ever a
degree or two removed from triumph.</p>
<p><em>Yet Mad About the Boy</em>, for all its familiar, delightful
notes, is also <em>==wincingly==</em> <em>==astute==</em> regarding
modernday dynamics, good and bad, for women of Bridget’s age. When her
friends encourage her to pursue Roxster, the idea is plausible not just
because Zellweger is still <em>==luminously==</em>
<em>==endearing==</em> in <em>==midlife==</em> , but because the world
really has changed: Women can date men a decade or more younger
<em>==without inciting mass hysteria==</em> . But they’ve remained
undesirable in other ways: Bridget works as a producer for a daytime TV
show where formerly <em>==hard-hitting==</em> female news reporters now
<em>==gush==</em> their way through <em>==cooking segments==</em> and
<em>==softball interviews==</em> . For female journalists over a certain
age, “HDTV was an <em>==extinction-level==</em> event,” Bridget’s friend
Talitha <em>==mutters==</em> .</p>
<p>The tension between sharp contemporary <em>==verisimilitude==</em>
and <em>==age-old romantic archetype==</em> helps explain why Bridget
<em>==potters==</em> on while so many other ’90s heroines have fallen by
the wayside. (Remember Ally McBeal? She of the <em>==miniskirts==</em>
and the <em>==catfights==</em> and the <em>==ludicrous==</em> workplace
dilemmas?) The book version of Bridget has come in for
<em>==derision==</em> as an embarrassing relic of
<em>==postfeminism==</em> , screwing up even the most basic personal and
professional tasks, and fixated on her thigh <em>==circumference==</em>
and her office crushes. In 2023, a <em>New York Times</em> retrospective
finally declared her “ <em>==nuttiness==</em> and
<em>==self-loathing==</em> ” to be well past its expiration date for
modern readers. Yet her movie comebacks continue to be irresistible, in
part because no one is more aware of her failings than Bridget
herself.</p>
<p>Crucially, she never lets her <em>==self-critique==</em> shake a
confidence lodged someplace inside her (even if she’s not quite sure
where). The academic Kelly A. Marsh has argued that despite her
<em>==ongoing==</em> preoccupation with becoming better, Bridget at her
core represents, through all her phases, the victory of self-acceptance.
She flourishes not just because of the love stories that the novels’
framing forces on her, but thanks to the faithful love of her friends
and her own <em>==stouthearted==</em> spirit.</p>
<p>There’s something <em>==poignant==</em> , too, about seeing Zellweger
in the role, despite all the <em>==indignities==</em> the actor has
suffered along the way—the 2000 cover shoot for <em>Harper’s
Bazaar</em>, rudely shelved because Zellweger had gained weight for the
role and was deemed too fat for a fashion magazine; the
<em>==tabloid==</em> coverage declaring her “ <em>==scary skinny==</em>
” when she then duly dieted; the discourse about her changing face, so
rabid and intrusive that she had to strike it down in a personal essay
for <em>HuffPost</em>. At 55, Zellweger is in what Germaine
<em>==Greer==</em> once cited as a decade of new “invisibility” for
women—a phenomenon that Bridget herself analyzes in her diary. And yet
here they both are: <em>==undaunted==</em> , blond, adorable, enduring,
changing the world by refusing to <em>==shrink away from it==</em> .
That, as Bridget might say, is v.v. good to see.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2022, I was 36 years old and jumping up and down in
my bathroom, trying to <em>==figure out==</em> my future. I had ordered
<em>==a fertility test==</em> online that said it would provide fast
results with just a few drops of blood. The videos on the company’s
website featured a smiling blond woman jumping—to stimulate blood flow,
naturally—and then <em>==e­ffortlessly==</em> <em>==dribbling==</em>
blood from her nger tips all over a little strip of test paper. All I
had to do was be like her. Joyful. <em>==Sanguineous==</em> .
Fertile.</p>
<p>For years, my husband, Rich, and I had <em>==gingerly==</em> walked
the prime <em>==meridian==</em> between wanting and not wanting kids,
usually leaning toward the “no” side. Having a baby had seemed un a­
ordable and impossible. On days when I nished work at 8 p.m., the
thought of <em>==procreating==</em> made me laugh, then
<em>==shudder==</em> .</p>
<p>Recently, though, I’d begun to reconsider. I was in the midst of an
<em>==admittedly==</em> strange-sounding project: I was spending a year
trying to change my personality. According to a scientific personality
test I’d taken, I scored sky-high on <em>==neuroticism==</em> , a trait
associated with anxiety and depression, and low on
<em>==agreeable==</em> <em>==ness==</em> and <em>==extroversion==</em> .
I lived in a constant, <em>==clenched==</em> state of dread, and it was
poisoning my life. My therapist had stopped laughing at my jokes.</p>
<p>But I had read some scientific research suggesting that you can
change your personality by behaving like the kind of person you wish you
were. Several studies show that people who want to be, say, less
isolated or less anxious can make a habit of socializing, meditating, or
journaling. Eventually these habits will come naturally,
<em>==knitting==</em> together to form new traits.</p>
<p>I knew that becoming a parent had the potential to change me in even
more profound ways. But I had no idea how. My own mother once said to
me, “I can’t picture you as a mother.” The truth was, neither could
I.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure I could get pregnant, even if I wanted to. My age put
me in a category that was, in a less delicate time, called “
<em>==geriatric==</em> ” for pregnancy, and one doctor told me my eggs
were probably of “poor quality.” The fertility test I’d ordered was
meant to determine if those eggs were <em>==serviceable==</em> . In the
bathroom, I unwrapped the <em>==glossy==</em> white box. The
instructions said the test would take 20 minutes and require a pack of
<em>==lancets==</em> . I grabbed one and <em>==stabbed==</em> it into my
geriatric forefinger. Two hours, five lancets, and a
<em>==graveyard==</em> of <em>==gauze==</em> and alcohol wipes later, I
still hadn’t squeezed a single <em>==droplet==</em> out of my finger.
Was I not jumping high enough? Was I already failing as a mother?</p>
<p>I was worried I wouldn’t be able to have a baby. I was also scared to
death of having one.</p>
<p><strong>Arguably, many things</strong> are wrong with me. I was
raised by Russian immigrants who constantly worried that the “
<em>==dark day==</em> ” was upon us, so hopeful thoughts about the
future of humanity don’t come naturally. I’m not a person who is a­ ected
by cuteness. I’ve never liked holding—or even really looking at—other
people’s babies. I don’t like animals. I couldn’t imagine
<em>==cooing==</em> and smiling at a baby as much as science says you’re
supposed to for their brain development.</p>
<p>My neuroticism made it especially hard to decide if I wanted kids,
because no process is more <em>==rife==</em> with uncertainty than
parenting, and nothing scares anxious people more than uncertainty. I
worried that Rich and I would ght more, and that our relationship would
su­ er. I worried about sleep <em>==deprivation==</em> . I felt
<em>==torn==</em> between my lifelong conviction that people shouldn’t
create problems for themselves and my (apparent) desire to do just
that.</p>
<p>I would wake up in the middle of the night and Google things like
<em>percent ==miscarriage== pregnant while 36?; anxiety pregnancy
miscarriage causes; Diet Coke fetal defects; pregnancy brain stops
working hands stop working</em>. These searches surfaced
<em>==horrific==</em> <em>==anecdotes==</em> , but never any conclusive
answers about what I should do. One time, I Googled reasons to have kids
and found an article that labeled all the reasons I had come up
with—like being cared for in old age and having someone who loves
me—with the heading “Not-So-Good Reasons to Have Children.”</p>
<p>But then I would remember the times we visited Rich’s mom, who had
<em>==dementia==</em> , in her nursing home. <em>==Her face lit up at
the sight of him==</em> . “My son, my son, my only son,” she’d say,
grabbing his arm. He was the only person she still recognized. The
visits were a reminder that the people who matter most at the end are
your children. The readers of your blog posts won’t make the trip.</p>
<p>Heather Rackin, a sociologist at Louisiana State University, found in
a study that the death of a mother or sibling increased the likelihood
that a woman would give birth within two years. The e proximity of death
is, perhaps, <em>==a wake-up call==</em> . Who will remember us? The
study was based on Rackin’s personal experience: When her father died in
2017, she decided not to wait any longer to have kids. His death got her
thinking, she told me, about what was important in life: the experience
of being loved and the chance to provide that love for someone else. Her
rst child was born in 2019.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to postpone or avoid having children— the
cost, the responsibility, <em>==the existence of and use case for the
NoseFrida==</em> . But in addition to the practical challenges, a
narrative has taken hold: Everything changes when you become a
mother.</p>
<p>Once they reach their 30s, many people have carefully cultivated
friend groups and <em>==sourdough==</em> starters and five-year plans.
They “really have a good sense of who they are, and then having a baby
totally disrupts everything that they thought they knew about
themselves,” says Lauren Ratli  , a <em>==perinatal==</em> therapist in
Illinois. Of course, this is where I di  er from the rest of my
<em>==cohort==</em> . By the time I was ready to have a baby, I’d
already been trying to disrupt everything about myself.</p>
<p>For my personality-change project, I had experimented with science-
backed strategies to turn down my neuroticism and <em>==amp==</em> up my
<em>==extroversion==</em> and <em>==agreeableness==</em> . I had spent
hundreds of hours trying out different <em>==iterations==</em> of
<em>==mindfulness==</em> , culminating in a day-long meditation retreat
that almost killed me with boredom but somehow <em>==alleviated==</em>
my depression. Among other agreeableness-boosting activities, I traveled
to London for a “conversation workshop,” where I learned techniques that
can make even British people show an emotion. And to become more
extroverted, I went out as much as humanly possible. I played table
tennis. I did <em>==improv==</em> , and survived.</p>
<p>For the most part, my efforts worked: I no longer thought of talking
with people as a waste of time. I became less afraid of uncertainty and
disappointment. I made one very good new friend. I drank less.</p>
<p>I had been changing, but it was a type of change that I directly
determined. I could go to happy hour, or not. I could meditate, or stop.
I was aware that <em>==parenthood==</em> would <em>==transform me
further==</em> , but what I found unsettling was that I couldn’t know
exactly how. Bizarrely, for the biggest disruption of your life, study
after study shows there’s no “typical” way that becoming a parent
changes your personality. Some studies have found tiny average decreases
in extroversion or openness among new parents— but even those findings
aren’t consistent.</p>
<p>Despite my progress, I was still too <em>==neurotic==</em> to feel
comfortable <em>==surrendering==</em> control and letting biology
<em>==mold==</em> me into someone I couldn’t predict and might not
recognize.</p>
<p><strong>After doctors pronounced</strong> me insufficiently fertile,
Rich and I decided to just stop being careful one month and see what
happened. We figured we would at least have some fun before we
<em>==embarked==</em> on our <em>==arduous==</em> “fertility
journey.”</p>
<p>A short time later, on a <em>==choppy==</em> boat tour in Europe, I
couldn’t stop <em>==leaning over==</em> the edge of the
<em>==catamaran==</em> and <em>==hurling==</em> .</p>
<p>“Do you think you might be pregnant?” Rich whispered <em>==as the
boat crew force-fed me pita bread==</em> .</p>
<p>“Don’t be <em>==insane==</em> ,” I said. Everyone knows that
37-year-olds— especially infertile ones—don’t get pregnant on their
first try.</p>
<p>A week after that, I found out that I had indeed gotten pregnant on
my first try.</p>
<p>Being pregnant means having your brain replaced with an anxiety
T-shirt cannon. I didn’t feel <em>==glowy==</em> or
<em>==goddessy==</em> ; I felt crazy. None of my friends has kids, and
many of them reacted to my news like I’d gotten a face
<em>==tattoo==</em> . One sent me a TikTok of everything that can
<em>==supposedly==</em> go wrong in pregnancy, including the possibility
that <em>==vomit==</em> will come out of your eyes. (It won’t.) I spent
more and more time by myself, obsessing over which <em>==swaddles==</em>
were best. (We didn’t end up using any.)</p>
<p>Thanks to <em>==a king tide of hormones==</em> ,
<em>==irritability==</em> <em>==spikes==</em> during the first and last
<em>==trimesters==</em> of pregnancy. People say your baby will remember
the sounds they hear in the <em>==womb==</em> , but I fear mine detected
little in there other than me screaming at his father. Every few weeks,
something would <em>==set me off==</em> , at a deafening volume. If
they’d <em>==overheard==</em> me, those couples therapists who say
<em>==contempt==</em> is the most glaring sign of a failed relationship
would probably have advised us to start <em>==divvying==</em> up our
furniture.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I was yelling, being so mean felt amazing— as though
I’d finally <em>==engulfed==</em> Rich in my distress. <em>Obviously you
need a travel ==stroller==</em> and <em>a regular stroller!</em> I
always apologized, and Rich always accepted my apology. But one time he
said, “You know that with a kid, <em>==that’s not really something you
can take back, right?==</em> ” Sometimes, late at night, after yet
another argument, I would rotate my <em>==spheroid==</em> belly toward
Rich and ask, “What if I turn out to be a bad mother?”</p>
<p>The rest of the pregnancy was horrible. I didn’t think it was
possible to feel so tired and still be technically alive. At my baby
shower, when some friends asked me how I was feeling, I quoted the
Russian <em>==dissident==</em> Boris Nadezhdin responding to a question
about whether he feared <em>==imprisonment==</em> or death: “The
<em>==tastiest==</em> and the sweetest years of my life are already in
the past.” (This is is the closest Russians get to excited.)</p>
<p>Three weeks before my due date, after a routine ultrasound, my
high-risk ob-gyn walked briskly into the room. She looked around for
something to sit on and, finding nothing, <em>==plopped down on top of a
closed trash==</em> can. She told me that something was wrong with my
<em>==placenta==</em> , and that the baby was in danger. And that I
should now <em>==walk over to the delivery wing of the hospita==</em>
l.</p>
<p><em>==In the antechamber of the operating room==</em> , I
<em>==hyperventilated==</em> in my paper gown and tapped out emails to
all my sources and <em>==bosses==</em> : <em>I’m having an emergency
C-section today, so I won’t be available for the next few months</em>.
My last day of caring whether people were mad at me.</p>
<p>Afterward, while <em>==the medical residents==</em> were rearranging
my <em>==innards==</em> , I thought I heard one of them ask me
something.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s going on down there at all,” I said
across the blue curtain.</p>
<p>“That’s … probably for the best,” the resident said.</p>
<p><strong>HE CAME OUT</strong> with white hair, a perfectly round face,
and a <em>==grumpy==</em> expression, like the leader of a former
Yugoslav republic. I called him “Slobodan” a couple of times, until Rich
told me to stop.</p>
<p>Because he was early, we panic-picked a name from our shortlist—
Evan. The same day he was born, doctors <em>==whisked==</em> him away to
the <em>==NICU==</em> ; I saw him only a few times before we were all
sent home days later. My <em>==discharge paperwork==</em> said, “Mom is
<em>==breastfeeding==</em> four or five times a day,” which was funny
because at that point I had not done it successfully even once. It was
also funny because I—quite possibly the least qualified person for the
job—was apparently “Mom.”</p>
<p>Once home, we entered the period we now refer to as “Cute Abu
Ghraib.” <em>==Sleep deprivation==</em> <em>==addled==</em> me to the
point that, on a call with the <em>==pediatrician==</em> , I forgot the
baby’s name. When Evan was two weeks old, I <em>==bit into a piece of
chicken==</em> and tasted something <em>==bloody==</em> and sharp. I had
ground my teeth so hard during his NICU stay that I’d <em>==loosened a
crown==</em> .</p>
<p>We <em>==agonized==</em> over whether the <em>==gyrations==</em> of
the SNOO Smart Sleeper Bassinet would rattle his brain too much, then
grew too exhausted to care. I became the CEO of Baby Inc., and Rich was
employee No. 1; we communicated only about <em>==ointments==</em> and
<em>==ounces==</em> . I finally had the big <em>==boobs==</em> of my
dreams, but the only man who saw them was two feet tall and couldn’t
read.</p>
<p>But then something interrupted the misery. One night, I was holding
Evan while he was sleeping. I had read that singing to your baby was
beneficial, so I decided to <em>==serenade==</em> him with one of the
few songs I know by heart: “Forever and Ever, Amen,” by Randy Travis.
Except I couldn’t seem to get through the fourth line: “This is love
that I feel for you always will be.” I, a bad bitch who has never cried
at a wedding, kept choking up.</p>
<p>Rich asked me if I was okay.</p>
<p>“Whatever!” I said, <em>==tears rolling down my cheeks==</em> . “Shut
up!”</p>
<p>I thought <em>==motherhood==</em> would be a forced march through
inert <em>==babyhood==</em> and <em>==feral==</em> <em>==toddler==</em>
years before we finally reached the golden time of my imagination:
having a talking, <em>==precocious==</em> elementary schooler. But there
I was, flooded with adoration for someone who barely registered my
presence. I’d hated being pregnant, so I thought I would hate having a
baby, too. But I loved him. I loved this.</p>
<p>Recall the research showing there’s no one way that parenthood tends
to change people’s personalities. Anecdotally, researchers told me that
they do notice certain patterns among new parents. Most moms worry about
their kid, more or less constantly, from the minute they find out
they’re pregnant. “ <em>==Signing up to be a parent is signing up to
have a lifetime of some degree of depression and anxiety==</em> ,”
Ratliff , the therapist, told me.</p>
<p>New parents’ satisfaction with their romantic relationship goes down,
especially for mothers, and especially in the first year. “ <em>==Guilt
is another universal==</em> ,” says Aurélie Athan, a clinical
psychologist at Columbia University’s Teachers College, who researches
the transition known as “ <em>==matrescence==</em> .” <em>==The creeping
sense==</em> that you should be with your kid while you’re working and
working while you’re with your kid apparently never goes away.</p>
<p>She told me that mothers become more <em>==attuned==</em> and
<em>==prosocial==</em> — more caring and empathetic toward others. Athan
said this is why so many mothers cry when their babies cry and have a
hard time watching <em>==gory==</em> movies. “Moms get a really bad
taste in their mouth with violent television or looking at images of
war,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s where she lost me. My son had <em>==colic==</em> ; for the
first four months, he screamed like the possessed unless he was within
the <em>==jiggly confines of his SNOO==</em> . The <em>==doula==</em> we
hired referred to him, alternately, as “Mr. Cheeks,” “Mr. Crab,” and,
<em>==sarcastically==</em> , “Mr. Wonderful.” If I had cried every time
he cried, I wouldn’t have had time to do anything else.</p>
<p>Eventually, Rich and I grew desensitized, or felt like we had to
match his chaotic energy with equally intense <em>==stimuli==</em> . One
night, after Evan <em>==wailed==</em> in our ears for two hours, we
shuffed downstairs and collapsed onto the couch. There was only one
thing we could think to watch that would serve as a
<em>==comedown==</em> from what had just happened: <em>Saving Private
Ryan</em>.</p>
<p>“Did you remember to <em>==sterilize==</em> the pump parts?” I asked
Rich as the <em>==entrails==</em> of American soldiers <em>==spilled
out==</em> over the beaches of Normandy.</p>
<p>“The sterilizer thing broke, so I had to reset it,” he said as a man
stumbled around <em>==with his arm blown off==</em> .</p>
<p>Even within these supposedly universal rules of parenthood, that is,
there’s a lot of variability. That’s because life events like parenthood
seem to change everyone di erently, and how you’ll change is, in part,
up to you. For a recent study, Ted Schwaba, a psychologist at Michigan
State University, and his co-authors asked thousands of Dutch people
about a life event in the past 10 years, such as a divorce or a new job,
that they felt had changed who they were as a person. About 7 percent of
the participants identified parenthood as the event that changed them,
and on average, they felt that it had made them slightly more agreeable
and <em>==conscientious==</em> .</p>
<p>But <em>==the big takeaway==</em> for Schwaba, from looking at all
the data for all the different types of life events, was that there
really was no pattern. Some people became more <em>==extroverted==</em>
when they got a new job. Some became less so. Some people actually
became less neurotic— that is, less depressed and anxious— after, say, a
cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>To Schwaba, this research suggests that it’s how you experience an
event such as parenthood, more than the event itself, that determines
how you’ll change. “The same event, like getting divorced, might be
someone’s worst thing that’s ever happened to them, and for someone
else, it might be the best thing that’s ever happened to them,” he told
me.</p>
<p>Or your personality might change not immediately after an event like
childbirth, but through a long process that the event sets in motion.
It’s not the cry you hear in <em>==the delivery room==</em> that changes
you; it’s the many years of researching child care and <em>==soothing
boo-boos==</em> that gradually turn you into someone new. To change, you
have to take steps every day to do so. Having a baby won’t make you a
better person. Behaving like a better person for your baby will.</p>
<p>Of all the things I wanted motherhood to change about me, neuroticism
was high on the list. Before I had Evan, I felt like I was personally
responsible for <em>==making life unfold perfectly==</em> , and whenever
I “failed” to do so, <em>==I had a meltdown==</em> . One day a few years
ago, I got a bad haircut, <em>==got stuck in traffic==</em> , and had
professional photos taken that looked terrible. My response to this—what
my new-parent eyes now see as an 8-out-of-10 day—was to <em>==chug half
a bottle of wine==</em> and scream to my husband through sobs, “I hate
everyone and everything!”</p>
<p>But now so much goes wrong every single day that there’s no time to
get upset about any one thing. I recently took a flight with Evan by
myself, an exercise that really underscores the first Noble Truth of
Buddhism (life is su­ ering). As I <em>==hauled==</em> the car seat, the
stroller, the baby, the diaper bag, and the <em>==trendy==</em> ,
impractical tote from my childless years to the TSA line, an airline
attendant took one look at me and said, “I know; it is too much.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the flight, I noticed that the two bottles of
formula Evan nervously drank during takeo­ had caught up with him, and
that <em>==he was now soaked with pee==</em> . I grabbed him under the
<em>==armpits==</em> and <em>==scooted==</em> across the seats to change
him in the airplane’s <em>==postage-stamp-size bathroom==</em> . With
one hand, I held him, crying, on the <em>==changing table==</em> , and
with the other, I dug a clean onesie out of the bottom of the diaper
bag. I fastened a million tiny onesie buttons. Then I saw that I had
<em>==misaligned==</em> them and fastened them again. Next it was my
turn. I couldn’t leave him on the changing table, or put him on the
disgusting floor. I <em>==yanked my leggings down==</em> and held him at
arm’s length as I <em>==peed==</em> .</p>
<p>By the end of that <em>==ordeal==</em> , I felt accomplished and
capable. I didn’t feel like sobbing; <em>==I felt like high-fiving
myself==</em> . I’ve let go in other ways, too. I show up at important
meetings without makeup on. I say weird stu­ff to strangers and don’t
analyze it obsessively later. Evan has forced me to step outside myself,
to break from the relentless self-focus that has contributed to both my
success and my unhappiness.</p>
<p>My remaining neuroses are <em>==laser-directed==</em> on his
well-being. I had initially planned not to breastfeed, but once I
started, I got so into it that when a doctor suggested that Evan would
spit up less if I cut food <em>==allergens==</em> from my diet, I
stopped eating virtually anything but oats and <em>==spinach for
months==</em> . When I was pregnant, we’d <em>==signed the unborn Evan
up for day care==</em> , but as the end of my <em>==maternity==</em>
<em>==leave loomed==</em> , I embarked on a frantic search for a
<em>==nanny==</em> so he could stay close to me while I worked from
home. I had always mentally mocked parents who checked to be sure their
babies were still breathing at night, then found myself standing in
front of his crib at 3 a.m., feeling for <em>==puffs of air from two
tiny nostrils==</em> .</p>
<p>I yell at Rich less than I used to, because not only is he employee
No. 1 of Baby Inc., but he’s the only employee, and frankly there are no
other applicants for the job. In fact, the whole experience has made me
kinder and more tender, like the Grinch, post–heart enlargement. I’m
less worried about wasting time, because all time with a baby is
essentially wasted—the most important nothing you’ll ever do in your
life. I even love Evan’s wet, violent “kisses,” which leave his
baby-teeth imprints on our jaws. When my friend Anton visited recently,
he watched me make <em>==horsey==</em> noises for Evan for what probably
felt like hours. “I can’t believe you love an infant!” he said.</p>
<p>During my interview with Ratli­ , I told her that Evan had lately been
losing interest in breastfeeding. I had awaited this day through months
of <em>==bleeding nipples and frustration==</em> , but now that it was
here, it was making me a bit sad. “Your baby’s moving to the next
stage,” she alarmed, “and this one is not going to come back again.” I
started <em>==tearing up==</em> —both at the memory of those bleary,
milk-soaked months together and at the realization that he wouldn’t even
be a baby for much longer.</p>
<p>During my personality-change experiment, my meditation teacher had
tried to hammer home the idea that “ <em>==this too shall pass==</em> ”
is both <em>==uplifting==</em> and sad: Nothing bad lasts forever, but
neither does anything good. Before I had Evan, I was focused on
<em>==impermanence==</em> ’s upsides: This uncomfortable improv show
will end; this awful pregnancy will too. But now I’m more keenly aware
of its downsides. The sleepless nights will end, but so too will the
times Evan squeals at a game of peekaboo, or spends an entire swim class
gazing up at me in awe. Every day brings a sigh of relief and a pang of
nostalgia. Having someone who loves you, I’ve decided, is a good reason
to have kids.</p>

<p>During an American election, a rich man can hand out $1 million
checks to prospective voters. Companies and people can use secretly
funded “dark money” nonprofits to donate unlimited money, anonymously,
to super PACs, which can then spend it on advertising campaigns.
Podcasters, partisans, or anyone, really, can tell outrageous,
incendiary lies about a candidate. They can boost those
<em>==falsehoods==</em> through targeted online advertising. No special
courts or election rules can stop the <em>==disinformation==</em> from
spreading before voters see it. The court of public opinion, which over
the past decade has seen and heard everything, no longer cares. U.S.
elections are now a political Las Vegas: Anything goes.</p>
<p>But that’s not the way elections are run in other countries. In
Britain, political parties are, at least during the run-up to an
election, limited to spending no more than £54,010 per candidate. In
Germany, as in many other European countries, the state funds political
parties, <em>==proportionate==</em> to their number of elected
<em>==parliamentarians==</em> , so that politicians do not have to
depend on, and become <em>==corrupted==</em> by, wealthy donors. In
Poland, courts <em>==fast-track==</em> election-related libel cases in
the weeks before a vote in order to discourage people from lying.</p>
<p>Nor is this unique to Europe. Many democracies have state or public
media that are obligated, at least in principle, to give equal time to
all sides. Many require political donations to be transparent, with the
names of donors listed in an online registry. Many have limits on
political advertising. Some countries also have rules about hate speech
and indict people who break them.</p>
<p>Countries apply these laws to create conditions for fair debate, to
build trust in the system, and to inspire confidence in the winning
candidates. Some democracies believe that transparency matters—that
voters should know who is funding their candidates, as well as who is
paying for political messages on social media or anywhere else. In some
places, these rules have <em>==a loftier goal==</em> : to prevent the
rise of anti democratic <em>==extremism==</em> of the kind that has
<em>==engulfed==</em> democracies— and especially European democracies—
in the past.</p>
<p>But for how much longer can democracies pursue these goals? We live
in a world in which <em>==algorithms==</em> controlled by American and
Chinese <em>==oligarchs==</em> choose the messages and images seen by
millions of people; in which money can move through secret bank accounts
with the help of <em>==crypto==</em> schemes; and in which this dark
money can then boost anonymous social-media accounts with the aim of
shaping public opinion. In such a world, how can any election rules be
enforced? If you are <em>==Albania==</em> , or even the United Kingdom,
do you still get to set the parameters of your public debate? Or are you
now forced to be Las Vegas too?</p>
<p><strong>ALTHOUGH IT’S EASY</strong> to get distracted by the
schoolyard nicknames and <em>==irresponsible==</em>
<em>==pedophilia==</em> accusations that Elon Musk <em>==flings==</em>
around, these are the real questions posed by his open, aggressive use
of X to spread false information and promote extremist and anti-European
politicians in the U.K., Germany, and elsewhere. The integrity of
elections— and the possibility of debate <em>==untainted==</em> by
misinformation injected from abroad—is equally challenged by TikTok, the
Chinese platform, and by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, whose
<em>==subsidiaries==</em> include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and
threads. TikTok says the company does not accept any paid political
advertising. Meta, which announced in January that it is abandoning
<em>==fact-checking==</em> on its sites in the U.S., also says it will
continue to comply with European laws. But even before Zucker berg’s
radical policy change, these promises were empty. Meta’s
<em>==vaunted==</em> content <em>==curation==</em> and moderation have
never been transparent. Nobody knew, and nobody knows, what exactly
Facebook’s algorithm was promoting and why. Even an occasional user of
these platforms encounters <em>==spammers==</em> , <em>==scammers==</em>
, and <em>==opaque==</em> accounts running foreign influence operations.
No guide to the algorithm, and no real choices about it, are available
on Meta products, X, or TikTok.</p>
<p>In truth, no one knows if any platforms really comply with
political-funding rules either, because nobody outside the companies can
fully monitor what happens online during an intense election
campaign—and after the voting has ended, it’s too late. According to
<em>==declassified==</em> Romanian-intelligence documents, someone
allegedly spent more than $1 million on TikTok content in the 18 months
before an election in support of a Romanian presidential candidate who
declared that he himself had spent nothing at all. In a belated attempt
to address this and other alleged discrepancies, a Romanian court
canceled the first round of that election, a decision that itself
damaged Romanian democracy.</p>
<p>Not all of this is new. <em>==Surreptitious==</em> political-party
funding was a feature of the Cold War, and the Russian government has
continued this practice, sometimes by offering deals to foreign
businesspeople close to pro-Russian politicians. Press moguls with
international political ambitions are hardly a <em>==novelty==</em> .
Rupert Murdoch, an Australian who has U.S. <em>==citizenship==</em> ,
has long played an outsize role in U.K. politics through his media
companies. John Major, the former British prime minister and
Conservative Party leader, has said that in 1997, Murdoch threatened to
pull his newspapers’ support unless the prime minister pursued a more
anti-European policy. Major refused. Murdoch has said, “I have never
asked a prime minister for anything,” but one of his Conservativeleaning
<em>==tabloids==</em> , <em>the Sun</em>, did endorse the Labour Party
in the next election. Major lost.</p>
<p>That incident now seems almost <em>==quaint==</em> . Even at the
height of its influence, the print edition of <em>the Sun</em> sold 4
million copies a day. More to the point, it operated, and still does,
within the <em>==constraints==</em> of U.K. rules and regulations, as do
all broadcast and print media. Murdoch’s newspapers take British
<em>==libel==</em> and <em>==hatespeech==</em> laws into consideration
when they run stories. His business strategy is necessarily shaped by
rules limiting what a single company can own. After his journalists were
accused of hacking phones and bribing police in the early 2000s, Murdoch
himself had to testify before an investigative commission, and he closed
down one of his tabloids for good.</p>
<p>Social media not only has far greater reach—Musk’s personal X account
has more than 212 million followers, giving him enormous power to set
the news agenda around the world— <em>==it also exists outside the legal
system==</em> . Under the American law known as Section 230, passed
nearly three decades ago, internet platforms are not treated as
publishers in the U.S. In practice, neither Facebook nor X has the same
legal responsibility for what appears on their platforms as do, say,
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and CNN. And this, too, has
consequences: Americans have created the information climate that other
countries must accept, and this allows <em>==deceptive==</em> election
practices to thrive. If countries don’t have their own laws, and until
recently most did not, Section 230 <em>==effectively==</em> requires
them to treat social-media companies as if they exist outside their
legal systems too.</p>
<p>Brazil broke with this pattern last year, when a judge demanded that
Musk comply with Brazilian laws against spreading misinformation and
political extremism, and forced X offline until he did. Several European
countries, including the U.K., Germany, and France, have also passed
laws designed to bring the platforms into compliance with their own
legal systems, mandating fines for companies that violate hatespeech
laws or host other illegal content. But these laws are controversial and
hard to enforce. Besides, “illegal speech” is not necessarily the
central problem. No laws prevented Musk from interviewing Alice Weidel,
a leader of the <em>==far-right==</em> Alternative for Germany (AfD)
party, on X, thereby providing her with a huge platform, available to no
other political candidate, in the month before a national election. the
interview, which included several <em>==glaringly==</em> false
statements (among others, that Weidel was the “leading” candidate), was
viewed 45 million times in 24 hours, a number far beyond the reach of
any German public or private media.</p>
<p><strong>ONLY ON INSTITUTION</strong> on the planet is large enough
and powerful enough to write and enforce laws that could make the tech
companies change their policies. Partly for that reason, the European
Union may soon become one of the Trump administration’s most
<em>==prominent==</em> targets. In theory, the EU’s Digital Services
Act, which <em>==took full effect==</em> last year, can be used to
regulate, fine, and, in extreme circumstances, ban internet companies
whose practices <em>==clash with==</em> European laws. Yet a primary
<em>==intent==</em> of the act is not <em>==punitive==</em> , but rather
to open up the platforms: to allow <em>==vetted==</em> researchers
access to platform data, and to give citizens more transparency about
what they hear and see. Freedom of speech also means the right to
receive information, and at the moment social-media companies operate
behind a curtain. We don’t know if they are promoting or suppressing
certain points of view, <em>==curbing==</em> or encouraging
<em>==orchestrated==</em> political campaigns, discouraging or provoking
violent riots. Above all, we don’t know who is paying for misinformation
to be spread online.</p>
<p>In the past, the EU has not hesitated to try to apply European law to
tech companies. Over the past decade, for example, Google has faced
three fines totaling more than $8 billion for breaking antitrust law
(though one of these fines was <em>==overturned==</em> by the EU’s
General Court in 2024).</p>
<p>In November, the European Commission ned Meta more than $800 million
for unfair trade practices. But for how much longer will the EU have
this authority? In the fall, J. D. Vance issued an extraordinarily
<em>==unsubtle==</em> threat, one that is frequently repeated in Europe.
“If NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to
continue to be a good participant in this military alliance,” Vance told
an interviewer, “why don’t you respect American values and respect free
speech?” Mark Zuckerberg, echoing Vance’s <em>==misuse==</em> of the
expression free speech to mean “freedom to conceal company practices
from the public,” put it even more <em>==crudely==</em> . In a
conversation with Joe Rogan in January, Zuckerberg said he feels
“optimistic” that President Donald Trump will intervene to stop the EU
from enforcing its own <em>==antitrust==</em> laws: “I think he just
wants America to win.”</p>
<p>Does America “winning” mean that European democracies, and maybe
other democracies, lose? Some European politicians think it might.
Robert Habeck, the German vice <em>==chancellor==</em> and a leader of
that country’s Green Party,</p>
<p>believes that Musk’s <em>==frenzies==</em> of political activity on X
aren’t the random <em>==blurts==</em> of an <em>==addled==</em> mind,
but rather are “logical and systematic.” In his New Year’s address,
Habeck said that Musk is deliberately “strengthening those who are
weakening Europe,” including the explicitly anti-European AfD. This, he
believes, is because “a weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom
regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power.”</p>
<p>Until recently, Russia was the most important state seeking to
<em>==undermine==</em> European institutions. Vladimir Putin has long
disliked the EU because it restricts Russian companies’ ability to
intimidate and <em>==bribe==</em> European political leaders and
companies, and because the EU is larger and more powerful than Russia,
whereas European countries on their own are not. Now a group of American
oligarchs also want to undermine European institutions, because they
don’t want to be regulated—and they may have the American president on
their side. Quite soon, the European Union, along with Great Britain and
other democracies around the world, might find that they have to choose
between their <em>==alliance==</em> with the United States and their
ability to run their own elections and select their own leaders without
the pressure of aggressive outside manipulation. <em>==Ironically==</em>
, countries, such as Brazil, that don’t have the same deep military,
economic, and cultural ties to the U.S. may and it easier to maintain
the <em>==sovereignty==</em> of their political systems and the
transparency of their information ecosystems than Europeans.</p>
<p>A <em>==crunch==</em> point is <em>==imminent==</em> , when the
European Commission finally concludes a year-long investigation into X.
<em>==Tellingly==</em> , two people who have advised the commission on
this investigation would talk with me only off the record, because the
potential for <em>==reprisals==</em> against them and their
organizations— whether it be online <em>==trolling==</em> and harassment
or lawsuits— is too great. Still, both advisers said that the commission
has the power to protect Europe’s sovereignty, and to force the
platforms to be more transparent. “¦e commission should look at the
<em>==raft==</em> of laws and rules it has available and see how they
can be applied,” one of them told me, “always remembering that this is
not about taking action against a person’s voice. ¦is is the commission
saying that everyone’s voice should be equal.”</p>
<p>At least in theory, no country is obligated to become <em>==an
electoral Las Vegas==</em> , as America has. Global democracies could
demand greater transparency around the use of algorithms, both on social
media and in the online-advertising market more broadly. ¦ey could other
consumers more control over what they see, and more information about
what they don’t see. ¦ey could enforce their own campaign-funding laws.
These changes could make the internet more open and fair, and therefore
a better, safer place for the exercise of free speech. If the chances of
success seem narrow, it’s not because of the lack of a viable legal
framework— rather it’s because, at the moment, <em>==cowardice==</em> is
as <em>==viral==</em> as one of Musk’s <em>==tweets==</em> .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lessons from the pandemic and its aftermath(by <em>David Frum</em>, a
staff writer at the Atlantic)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years ago, the coronavirus pandemic <em>==struck a bitterly
divided society==</em> .</p>
<p>Americans first <em>==diverged over==</em> how dangerous the disease
was: just a flu (as President Donald Trump repeatedly insisted) or
something much deadlier.</p>
<p>Then they <em>==disputed==</em> public-health measures such as
<em>==lockdowns==</em> and masking; a majority <em>==complied==</em>
while a passionate minority fiercely resisted.</p>
<p>Finally, they split—and have remained split—over the value and safety
of COVID-19 vaccines. Anti-vaccine beliefs <em>==started on the
fringe==</em> , but they spread to the point where Ron DeSantis, the
governor of the country’s third-most- <em>==populous==</em> state,
launched a campaign for president on an appeal to anti-vaccine
ideology.</p>
<p>Five years later, one side has seemingly triumphed. The winner is not
the side that initially prevailed, the side of public safety. The winner
is the side that minimized the disease, then rejected publichealth
measures to prevent its spread, and finally refused the vaccines
designed to protect against its worst effects.</p>
<p>Ahead of COVID ’s fifth anniversary, Trump, as president-elect,
nominated the country’s most <em>==outspoken==</em> vaccination opponent
to <em>==head==</em> the Department of Health and Human Services. He
chose a <em>==proponent==</em> of the <em>==debunked==</em> and
<em>==discredited==</em> vaccines-cause-autism claim to lead the CDC. He
named a <em>==strident==</em> critic of COVID-vaccine
<em>==mandates==</em> to lead the FDA. For surgeon general, he picked a
believer in hydroxychloroquine, the <em>==disproven==</em> COVID-19
remedy. His pick for director of the National Institutes of Health had
advocated for letting COVID spread unchecked to encourage <em>==herd
immunity==</em> . Despite having <em>==fast-tracked==</em> the develop
ment of the vaccines as president, Trump has himself
<em>==trafficked==</em> in many forms of COVID-19 denial, and has
expressed his own suspicions that childhood vaccination against
<em>==measles==</em> and <em>==mumps==</em> is a cause of
<em>==autism==</em> .</p>
<p>The <em>==ascendancy==</em> of the anti-vaxxers may ultimately prove
<em>==fleeting==</em> . But if the forces of science and health are to
<em>==stage a comeback==</em> , it’s important to understand why those
forces have <em>==gone into eclipse==</em></p>
<p><strong>From March 2020 to</strong> February 2022, about 1 million
Americans died of COVID-19. Many of those deaths occurred after vaccines
became available. If every adult in the United States had received two
doses of a COVID vaccine by early 2022, rather than just the 64 percent
of adults who had, nearly 320,000 lives would have been saved.</p>
<p>Why did so many Americans resist vaccines? Perhaps the biggest reason
was that the pandemic <em>==coincided==</em> with a
presidential-election year, and Trump instantly recognized the crisis as
a threat to his chances for re-election. He responded by denying the
seriousness of the pandemic, promising that the disease would rapidly
disappear on its own, and promoting <em>==quack==</em> cures.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines were developed while Trump was president. They
could have been advertised as a Trump achievement. But by the time they
became widely available, Trump was out of office. His supporters had
already made up their minds to distrust the public-health authorities
that promoted the vaccines. Now they had an additional
<em>==incentive==</em> : Any benefit from vaccination would
<em>==redound==</em> to Trump’s successor, Joe Biden. Vaccine rejection
became a badge of group loyalty, one that ultimately cost many
lives.</p>
<p>A summer 2023 study by Yale researchers of voters in Florida and Ohio
found that during the early phase of the pandemic, self-identified
Republicans died at only a slightly higher rate than self-identified
Democrats in the same age range. But once vaccines were introduced,
Republicans became much more likely to die than Democrats. In the spring
of 2021, the excess-death rate among Florida and Ohio Republicans was 43
percent higher than among Florida and Ohio Democrats in the same age
range. By the late winter of 2023, the 300-odd most pro-Trump counties
in the country had a COVID-19 death rate more than two and a half times
higher than the 300 or so most anti-Trump counties.</p>
<p>In 2016, Trump had boasted that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue
and not lose any votes. In 2021 and 2022, his most <em>==fervent==</em>
supporters risked death to prove their loyalty to Trump and his
<em>==cause==</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Why did political</strong> <em>==fidelity==</em> express
itself in such selfharming ways?</p>
<p>The <em>==onset==</em> of the pandemic was an unusually confusing and
<em>==disorienting==</em> event. Some people who got COVID died. Others
lived. Some suffered only mild symptoms. Others spent weeks on
<em>==ventilators==</em> , or <em>==emerged==</em> with long COVID and
never fully recovered. Some lost businesses built over a lifetime.
Others refinanced their homes with 2 percent interest rates and banked
the savings.</p>
<p>We live in an <em>==impersonal==</em> universe, indifferent to our
hopes and wishes, subject to extreme randomness. We don’t like this at
all. We crave satisfying explanations. We want to believe that somebody
is <em>==in control==</em> , even if it’s somebody we don’t like. At
least that way, we can blame bad events on bad people. This is the
eternal appeal of <em>==conspiracy theories==</em> . <em>How did this
happen? Somebody must have done it— but who? And why?</em></p>
<p><em>==Compounding==</em> the <em>==disorientation==</em> , the
coronavirus outbreak was a rapidly changing story. The scientists who
researched COVID-19 knew more in April 2020 than they did in February;
more in August than in April; more in 2021 than in 2020; more in 2022
than in 2021. The official advice kept changing: <em>Stay inside—no, go
outside. Wash your hands—no, mask your face</em>. Some Americans
appreciated and accepted that knowledge improves <em>==over time==</em>
, that more will be known about a new disease in <em>==month two==</em>
than in <em>==month one==</em> . But not all Americans saw the world
that way. They mistrusted the idea of knowledge as a developing process.
Such Americans wondered: <em>Were they lying before? Or are they lying
now?</em></p>
<p>In a different era, Americans might have <em>==deferred==</em> more
to medical authority. The internet has upended old ideas of what should
count as authority and who possesses it. The pandemic reduced normal
human interactions. Severed from one another, Americans deepened their
para social attachment to social-media platforms, which
<em>==foment==</em> alienation and rage. Hundreds of thousands of people
plunged into <em>==an alternate mental universe==</em> during COVID-19
lockdowns. When their doors reopened, the <em>==mania==</em> did not
<em>==recede==</em> . Conspiracies and mistrust of the
establishment—never strangers to the American mind—had been nourished,
and they grew.</p>
<p><strong>The experts</strong> themselves contributed to this loss of
trust.</p>
<p>It’s now agreed that we had little to fear from going outside in
dispersed groups. But that was not the state of knowledge in the spring
of 2020. At the time, medical experts insisted that any kind of mass
outdoor event must be sacrificed to the <em>==imperatives==</em> of the
emergency. In mid-March 2020, federal public-health authorities shut
down some of Florida’s beaches. In California, surfers faced heavy fines
for <em>==venturing==</em> into the ocean. Even the COVID-skeptical
Trump White House reluctantly canceled the April 2020 Easteregg
roll.</p>
<p>And then the experts abruptly reversed themselves. When George Floyd
was choked to death by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020,
hundreds of thousands of Americans left their homes to protest,
<em>==defying==</em> three months of <em>==urgings==</em> to avoid large
gatherings of all kinds, outdoor as well as indoor.</p>
<p>On May 29, the American Public Health Association issued a statement
that proclaimed racism a public-health crisis while
<em>==conspicuously==</em> refusing to condemn the sudden
<em>==defiance==</em> of public-safety rules.</p>
<p>The next few weeks saw the largest mass protests in recent U.S.
history. Approximately 15 million to 26 million people attended outdoor
Black Lives Matter events in June 2020, according to a series of
reputable <em>==polls==</em> . Few, if any, scientists or doctors
scolded the attendences—and many politicians joined the protests,
including future Vice President Kamala Harris. It all raised a
suspicion: <em>Maybe the authorities were making the rules based on
politics, not science.</em></p>
<p>The <em>==politicization==</em> of health advice became even more
<em>==consequential==</em> as the summer of 2020 ended. Most American
public schools had closed in March. “At their peak,” <em>Education</em>
Week reported, “the closures affected at least 55.1 million students in
124,000 U.S. public and private schools.” By September, it was already
apparent that COVID-19 posed relatively little risk to children and
teenagers, and that remote learning did not work. At the same time,
returning to the classroom before vaccines were available could pose
some risk to teachers’ health—and possibly also to the health of the
adults to whom the children returned after school.</p>
<p>How to balance these concerns given the <em>==imperfect==</em>
information? Liberal states decided in favor of the teachers. In
California, the majority of students did not return to in-person
learning until the fall of 2021. New Jersey kept many of its public
schools closed until then as well. Similar things happened in many other
states: Illinois, Maryland, New York, and so on, through the states that
voted Democratic in November 2020.</p>
<p>Florida, by contrast, reopened most schools in the fall of 2020.
Texas soon followed, as did most other Republican-governed states. The
COVID risk for students, it turned out, was minimal: According to a 2021
CDC study, less than 1 percent of Florida students
<em>==contracted==</em> COVID-19 in school settings from August to
December 2020 after their state restarted in-person learning. Over the
2020–21 school year, students in states that voted for Trump in the 2020
election got an average of almost twice as much <em>==inperson==</em>
instruction as students in states that voted for Biden.</p>
<p>Any risks to teachers and school staff could have been
<em>==mitigated==</em> by the universal vaccination of those groups. But
deep into the fall of 2021, thousands of blue-state teachers and staff
resisted vaccine mandates— including more than 5,000 in Chicago alone.
By then, another school year had been interrupted by closures.</p>
<p><strong>BY DISPARAGING</strong> public-health methods and
<em>==discrediting==</em> vaccines, the COVID-19 <em>==minimizers==</em>
cost hundreds of thousands of people their lives. By keeping schools
closed longer than absolutely necessary, the COVID maximizers hazarded
the futures of young Americans.</p>
<p>Students from poor and troubled families, in particular, will
continue to pay the cost of these learning losses for years to come.
Even in liberal states, many private schools reopened for in-person
instruction in the fall of 2020. The <em>==affluent==</em> and <em>==the
connected==</em> could buy their children a continuing education
unavailable to those who depended on public schools. Many lower-income
students did not return to the classroom: Throughout the 2022–23 school
year, poorer school districts reported much higher
<em>==absenteeism==</em> rates than were seen before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Teens absent from school typically get into trouble in ways that are
even more damaging than the loss of math or reading skills. New York
City arrested 25 percent more minors for serious crimes in 2024 than in
2018. The national trend was similar, if less stark. The FBI reports
that although crime in general declined in 2023 compared with 2022,
crimes by minors rose by nearly 10 percent.</p>
<p>People who finish schooling during a recession tend to do worse even
into middle age than those who finish in times of prosperity. They are
less likely to marry, less likely to have children, and more likely to
die early. The <em>==disparity==</em> between those who finish in lucky
years and those who finish in unlucky years is greatest for people with
the least formal education.</p>
<p>Will the harms of COVID prove equally enduring? We won’t know for
some time. But if past experience holds, the COVID-19 years will mark
their most <em>==vulnerable==</em> victims for decades.</p>
<p><strong>THE STORY OF COVID</strong> can be told as one of shocks and
disturbances that wrecked two presidencies. In 2020 and 2024,
<em>==incumbent==</em> administrations lost elections back-to back,
something that hadn’t happened since the deep economic depression of the
late 1880s and early 1890s. The pandemic caused a recession as steep as
any in U.S. history. The aftermath saw the worst inflation in half a
century.</p>
<p>In the three years from January 2020 through December 2022, Trump and
Biden both signed a series of major bills to revive and rebuild the U.S.
economy. Altogether, they swelled the gross public debt from about $20
billion in January 2017 to nearly $36 billion today. The weight of that
debt helped drive interest rates and mortgage rates higher. The burden
of the pandemic debt, like learning losses, is likely to be with us for
quite a long time.</p>
<p>Yet even while acknowledging all that went wrong, respecting all the
lives lost or ruined, reckoning with all the lasting harms of the crisis
, we do a dangerous <em>==injustice==</em> if we remember the story of
COVID solely as a story of American failure. In truth, the story is one
of strength and <em>==resilience==</em> .</p>
<p>Scientists did deliver vaccines to prevent the disease and treatments
to recover from it. Economic policy did avert a global depression and
did rapidly restore economic growth. Government assistance kept
households afloat when the world shut down— and new remote-work
practices enabled new patterns of freedom and happiness after the
pandemic ended.</p>
<p>The virus was first detected in December 2019. Its
<em>==genome==</em> was sequenced within days by scientists
collaborating across inter national borders. Clinical trials for the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began in April 2020, and the vaccine was
authorized for emergency use by the FDA in December. Additional vaccines
rapidly followed, and were universally available by the spring of 2021.
The weekly death <em>==toll==</em> fell by more than 90 percent from
January 2021 to midsummer of that year.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy roared back with a strength and power that
<em>==stunned==</em> the world. The initial <em>==spike==</em> of
inflation has <em>==subsided==</em> . Wages are again rising faster than
prices. Growth in the United States in 2023 and 2024 was faster and
broader than in any peer economy.</p>
<p>Even more <em>==startling==</em> , the U.S. recovery
<em>==outpaced==</em> China’s. That nation’s <em>==bounceback==</em>
from COVID-19 has been slow and <em>==faltering==</em> . America’s
economic lead over China, once thought to be narrowing, has suddenly
widened; the gap between the two countries’ GDPs grew from $5 trillion
in 2021 to nearly $10 trillion in 2023. The U.S. share of world economic
output is now slightly higher than it was in 1980, before China began
any of its economic reforms. As he did in 2016, Trump
<em>==inherits==</em> a strong and healthy economy, to which his own
<em>==reckless==</em> policies— notably, his trade protectionism—are the
only visible threat.</p>
<p>In public affairs, our bias is usually to pay most attention to
disappointments and mistakes. In the pandemic, there were many errors:
the partisan <em>==dogma==</em> of the COVID minimizers; the
<em>==capitulation==</em> of states and <em>==municipalities==</em> to
favored interest groups; the hypo chondria and neuroticism of some COVID
maximizers. Errors need to be studied and the lessons
<em>==heeded==</em> if we are to do better next time. But if we fail to
acknowledge America’s successes—even partial and imperfect successes— we
not only do an injustice to the American people. We also defeat in
advance their confidence to collectively meet the crises of
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s time for some national self-forgiveness here. Perhaps
it’s time to accept that despite all that went wrong, despite how much
there was to learn about the disease and how little time there was to
learn it, and despite polarized politics and an <em>==unruly==</em>
national character—despite all of that—Americans collectively met the
COVID-19 emergency about as well as could reasonably have been
hoped.</p>
<p>The wrong people have profited from the immediate aftermath. But if
we remember the pandemic accurately, the future will belong to those who
rose to the crisis when their country needed them</p>
