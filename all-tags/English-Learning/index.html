(Yes, rocks)</h1>
<p>The Canary Islands are home to Mount Teide, one of the world’s
largest active volcanoes.</p>
<p>Capable of <em>==spewing==</em> tens of millions of cubic meters of
lava in a single eruption, Teide’s destructive power <em>==is nothing to
scoff at==</em> .</p>
<p>But there may be a way to use the <em>==basalt==</em> rock inside
Teide to save humanity.</p>
<p>That’s right—blowing up this volcano could offset Earth’s emissions
for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Obviously, destroying an ancient volcano is not a good idea.</p>
<p>The ecological <em>==fallout==</em> would be catastrophic and
unpredictable.</p>
<p>But even if we harvested some of that basalt, could we really use it
to stop climate change?</p>
<p>This theoretical scheme is a dramatic way to enhance one of Earth’s
least dramatic natural processes: rock weathering.</p>
<p>Rock weathering occurs whenever it rains.</p>
<p>As falling rainwater mixes with atmospheric carbon dioxide, it
becomes a weak acid that can <em>==eat away at==</em> minerals called
silicates.</p>
<p>And since silicates are in over 90% of Earth’s exposed rock, this
happens pretty much anywhere rain hits stone.</p>
<p>As this acid reacts with the stone, the dissolved carbon dioxide in
the rainwater turns into a new form called bicarbonate, which trickles
downstream alongside the rain to the ocean.</p>
<p>Here, marine <em>==critters==</em> use it to create structures like
shells.</p>
<p>And when they die, those shells sink to the <em>==seafloor==</em> ,
trapping that carbon dioxide in the ocean for <em>==millennia==</em>
.</p>
<p>This process has a massive impact on Earth’s climate.</p>
<p>When it’s warm and wet, the rock weathering speeds up,
<em>==tempering==</em> greenhouse warming.</p>
<p>When it’s cold and dry, the process slows down, building up
atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>But these effects take time—natural rock weathering balances Earth’s
climate over millions of years.</p>
<p>Thankfully, experts working to sequester atmospheric carbon have
plans to speed things up.</p>
<p>Two major factors determine the pace of this process: the types of
rock exposed to weather and the amount of rock that’s exposed.</p>
<p>Silicates that form at higher temperatures tend to weather faster due
to their chemical composition.</p>
<p>These rocks include those from Earth’s deep <em>==mantle==</em> and
volcanic rocks like basalt.</p>
<p>But piled up in a mountain, not very much rock is exposed.</p>
<p>So, some climate experts believe we should harvest that
fast-weathering rock, <em>==crush==</em> it, and spread it out to
weather more rock in less time.</p>
<p>This sped-up process is called enhanced rock weathering, and it’s
among the most practical plans we have for drawing down carbon.</p>
<p>Rather than needing to invent all-new technology, we can rely on
existing systems for mining and processing rock.</p>
<p>And since agricultural communities have long known that volcanic
rocks and soils can improve crop yield, farmlands could be the perfect
<em>==dispersal==</em> sites.</p>
<p>But for this approach to have impact, it needs to be deployed
globally.</p>
<p>And even without <em>==demolishing==</em> any volcanoes, large-scale
solutions always come with large-scale problems.</p>
<p>First off, rock weathering—enhanced or otherwise—runs through the
entire global water cycle.</p>
<p>Since this open system has more variables than we could ever account
for, it’s difficult to measure enhanced rock weathering’s precise
impact.</p>
<p>Second, despite existing mining technology, it would be a massive
ecological and engineering challenge to <em>==quarry==</em> , crush,
transport, and spread this much rock.</p>
<p>The logistical difficulty of distributing this material would be
similarly demanding.</p>
<p>And unless the energy used for both tasks came from mostly clean
sources, it would undermine the project’s net carbon impact.</p>
<p>Finally, any endeavor that impacts Earth’s natural systems at this
scale might have unpredictable side effects.</p>
<p>For example, quarried rocks might contain dangerous heavy metals or
other unknown elements.</p>
<p>But these challenges aren’t reasons to abandon enhanced rock
weathering—they’re just the first obstacles to implementing this
promising strategy.</p>
<p>Simulations suggest a global enhanced rock weathering program that
spreads 10 tons of basalt dust on every hectare of global farmland could
<em>==sequester==</em> over 200 <em>==gigatons==</em> of CO₂ over a
75-year period.</p>
<p>Those are remarkable figures for an approach this cheap and
practical, and they prove you don’t need to blow up a mountain to have a
big impact.</p>

                    <h1 id="what-staying-up-all-night-does-to-your-brain">What staying up
all night does to your brain</h1>
<p>You’re just one Roman Empire history final away from a relaxing
spring break.</p>
<p>But you still have so much to study!</p>
<p>So you decide to follow in the footsteps of many students before you
and pull an all-nighter.</p>
<p>When you stay up all night, you’re fighting against your body’s
natural circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>These are the cyclical changes that virtually all living things
experience over the course of a 24-hour period—such as sleeping and
waking—and they’re heavily influenced by light.</p>
<p>But for the moment, you’re alert and powering through the rule of
Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>As the sun sets, your eyes send signals about the dwindling light to
a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>This is basically your circadian rhythm’s clock.</p>
<p>It alerts your pineal gland to start producing melatonin.</p>
<p>That’s the hormone that helps prepare your body for sleep, and levels
start to rise about two hours before your normal bedtime.</p>
<p>At the same time, neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem release
a compound called GABA.</p>
<p>This slows down activity in your brain and can have a calming
effect.</p>
<p>You’re approaching your normal bedtime.</p>
<p>Since the brain needs to cool down before sleep, your core body
temperature starts to drop.</p>
<p>Huh, that map kind of looks like a face.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, your attention has started to drift.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, your brain has been releasing a waste product
called adenosine.</p>
<p>The more adenosine latching onto receptors in your brain, the more
tired and inattentive you become.</p>
<p>Time for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors, which can give
you a boost of energy.</p>
<p>However, it might also make you jittery and increase your
anxiety.</p>
<p>You’re acing these flashcards!</p>
<p>Right now these dates and names are being stored in an area of the
brain called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Normally when you go to sleep, memories like these are consolidated
and slotted into long-term storage in your brain’s neocortex.</p>
<p>So it’s a good thing you only need to remember this information
through tomorrow.</p>
<p>Microsleeps are unpredictable periods of sleep that last for only a
few seconds and are triggered by sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>You stretch in an attempt to stay awake.</p>
<p>But at this point your motor skills have also taken a hit.</p>
<p>Studies have found that people who have been awake for 19 hours have
similar coordination and reaction times as those who have been
drinking.</p>
<p>As the sun rises, your pineal gland stops releasing melatonin.</p>
<p>You feel a “second wind” come on.</p>
<p>And despite everything, you leave for school in a really good
mood.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation can briefly induce euphoria.</p>
<p>It’s caused by a temporary boost in dopamine levels, which can
unfortunately also lead to poor choices.</p>
<p>The final starts off well.</p>
<p>It’s all multiple choice!</p>
<p>But then you get to the essay portion.</p>
<p>It’s thought that during sleep, our brains process ideas and draw
connections between new memories and old ones.</p>
<p>So your sleepless brain might be able to regurgitate facts, but
you’re finding it more difficult to find patterns or problem solve.</p>
<p>You stare at the blank page, defeated.</p>
<p>You head up to your room, anxious and irritable.</p>
<p>Your amygdala, the part of the brain involved with processing
emotion, is going haywire.</p>
<p>Your prefrontal cortex usually keeps your amygdala in check, but it
still isn’t firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>Your bed has never felt so sweet.</p>
<p>After one sleepless night, your body and brain bounce back pretty
quickly.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing since we can’t always control how much sleep we
get.</p>
<p>But going for long periods without a good night’s sleep or constantly
changing your bedtime can take its toll.</p>
<p>Regularly getting less than seven hours of sleep each night is linked
to all sorts of health issues, from diabetes to stroke to chronic
pain.</p>
<p>It also leaves you more vulnerable to developing mental health issues
like depression.</p>
<p>Your sleep schedule can even affect your grades.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that college students who keep regular sleep hours
have, on average, a higher GPA than students who don’t.</p>
<p>So the next time you’re thinking of pulling an all-nighter, remember
that Rome wasn’t built in a day, or for that matter, one night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the MAGA vision of the national interest, America will be more
like Russia, China, and Iran. (BY <em>GEORGE PACKER</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to <em>==dismantle==</em> the federal government, then
<em>==repurpose==</em> it as a tool of personal power and ideological
warfare, is to start with the soft targets. Entitlements and defense,
which comprise more than half of federal spending and a large share of
its fraud and waste, enjoy too much support for Elon Musk to <em>==roll
them up==</em> easily. But nothing is less popular than sending
taxpayers’ money to unknown people in poor, faraway countries that might
<em>==be rife with corruption==</em> . Americans dislike foreign aid so
much that they wrongly believe it consumes at least a quarter of the
budget (in the previous fiscal year, aid constituted barely 1 percent).
President John F. Kennedy understood the problem, and after creating the
United States Agency for International Development, in 1961, he told his
advisers: “We hope we can tie this whole concept of aid to the safety of
the United States. That is the reason we give aid. The test is whether
it will serve the United States. Aid is not a good word. Perhaps we can
describe it better as ‘Mutual Assistance.’ ” At another meeting, Kennedy
suggested “International Security.”</p>
<p>USAID continued for the next six decades because leaders of both
parties believed that ending <em>==polio==</em> , preventing famine,
stabilizing poor countries, strengthening democracies, and opening new
markets served the United States. But on January 20, within hours of his
inauguration, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that
froze foreign aid. USAID was instructed to stop nearly all work. Its
Washington headquarters was occupied and sensitive data were
<em>==seized==</em> by <em>==whiz==</em> kids from Musk’s Department of
Government Efficiency, or DOGE. One of their elder members, a 25-yearold
software engineer and Matt Gaetz fan named Gavin Kliger, acquired an
official email address to instruct the staff of USAID to stay home.</p>
<p>Contractors were fired and employees <em>==were placed on indefinite
leave==</em> ; those on overseas missions were given 30 days to return
to the States with their families. Under orders to remain silent, they
used <em>==pseudonyms==</em> on encrypted chats to inform the outside
world of what was going on. When I spoke on Signal with government
employees, they sounded as if they were in Moscow or Tehran. “It felt
like it went very <em>==authoritarian==</em> very quickly,” one
<em>==civil servant==</em> told me. “You have to watch everything you
say and do in a way that is gross.”</p>
<p>The website usaid.gov vanished, then <em>==reappeared==</em> with a
<em>==bare-bones==</em> announcement of the organization’s
<em>==dismemberment==</em> , followed by the message “Thank you for your
service.” A <em>==veteran==</em> USAID official called it “
<em>==brutal==</em> — from some 20-yearold idiot who doesn’t know
anything. What the fuck do you know about my service?” <em>==A curtain
fell over the public information==</em> that could have served to
challenge the <em>==outpouring==</em> of lies and
<em>==distortions==</em> from the White House and from Musk, who called
USAID “a criminal organization” and “evil.” If you looked into the
charges, nearly all turned out to be <em>==outright==</em>
<em>==falsehoods==</em> , highly misleading, or isolated examples of the
kind of stupid, wasteful programs that exist in any organization.</p>
<p>A <em>==grant==</em> for hundreds of ethnic-minority students from
Myanmar to attend universities throughout Southeast Asia became a
propaganda tool in the hands of the <em>==wrecking crew==</em> because
it went under the name “Diversity and <em>==Inclusion==</em> Scholar
ship Program”—as if the money were going to a “woke” bureaucracy, not to
Rohingya refugees from the military regime’s <em>==genocide==</em> . The
<em>==orthodoxy==</em> of a previous administration required the
<em>==terminology==</em> ; the orthodoxy of the new one has ended the
students’ education and forced them to return to the country that
<em>==oppressed==</em> them. One of Trump’s executive orders is called
“Defending Women Against Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring
Biological Truth to the Federal Government”; meanwhile, the
administration suspended the online education of nearly 1,000 women in
Afghanistan who had been studying undetected by the Taliban with funding
from the State Department.</p>
<p>But hardly anyone in this country knows these things.
<em>==Contesting==</em> Musk’s algorithmically boosted lies on X with
the tools of a reporter is like fighting a wildfire with a garden
hose.</p>
<p>With no workforce or funding, USAID’s efforts around the
world—vaccine campaigns in Nepal, HIV-drug distribution in Nigeria,
nutrition for starving children in Sudanese refugee camps—were forced to
end. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who <em>==championed==</em> USAID
as a senator and now, as the agency’s acting head, is its
<em>==executioner==</em> ) issued a <em>==waiver==</em> for lifesaving
programs. But it proved almost meaningless, because the people needed to
run the programs were locked out of their computers, had no way to
communicate, and feared punishment if they kept working.</p>
<p>The <em>==heedlessness==</em> of the aid <em>==wreckers==</em>
recalls Nick Carraway’s description in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> of Tom
and Daisy Buchanan: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they
smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money
or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together,
and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” An agency of
10,000 employees is shrinking to about 300 and, despite its
<em>==statutory==</em> independence, being dissolved into the State
Department. The veteran USAID official I spoke with foresaw a
<em>==skeletal==</em> operation reduced to health and food assistance,
with everything else—education, the environment, governance, economic
development—gone.</p>
<p>But even basic <em>==humanitarian==</em> programs will be nearly
impossible to sustain with the numbers that the administration
<em>==envisions==</em> —for example, 12 staff members for all of
Africa.</p>
<p>“This is the infrastructure and architecture that has given us a
doubling of the human lifespan,” Atul Gawande, the writer and surgeon
who was the most recent, and perhaps last, head of the agency’s Bureau
for Global Health, told me. “Taking it down kills people.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump and Musk’s</strong> destruction of USAID was a trial
<em>==blitzkrieg==</em> : Send tanks and <em>==bombers==</em> into
<em>==defenseless==</em> Poland to see what works before turning on the
Western powers. The <em>==assault==</em> provided a model for
<em>==eviscerating==</em> the rest of the federal bureaucracy. It also
demonstrated the radicalism of Trump’s view of America’s role in the
world.</p>
<p>Every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama understood
that American power was enhanced, not threatened, by attaching it to
alliances, institutions, and values that the American people support,
such as freedom, <em>==pluralism==</em> , and humanitarianism. This was
the common idea behind Harry Truman’s Marshall Plan for
<em>==postwar==</em> Europe, Kennedy’s establishment of USAID, Jimmy
Carter’s creation of the U.S. refugee program, and George W. Bush’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. These weren’t simple acts of generosity.
They were designed to prevent chaos and misery from overwhelming other
countries and, eventually, harming our own. They expanded American
influence by attraction rather than <em>==coercion==</em> , showing
people around the world that the <em>==Leviathan==</em> could benefit
them, too. Political scientists call this “soft power.”</p>
<p>Every president betrayed these ideas in one way or another, making
U.S. foreign policy <em>==a fat target==</em> for criticism at home and
abroad, by the left and the right. Kennedy used foreign aid to
<em>==wage==</em> a bloody <em>==counterinsurgency==</em> in South
Vietnam; Carter put human rights at the center of his policy and then
<em>==toasted the repressive==</em> <em>==shah==</em> of Iran; Bush,
claiming to be spreading democracy to the Middle East, seriously damaged
America’s global legitimacy. USAID <em>==antagonized==</em> host
governments and local populations with its <em>==arrogance==</em> and
<em>==bloat==</em> . “We had a hand in our own destruction,” one
longtime official told me. “We threw money in areas we didn’t need
to.”</p>
<p>But the alternative to the <em>==hypocrisies==</em> of soft power and
the postwar liberal order was never going to be a <em>==chastened==</em>
, <em>==humbler==</em> American foreign policy— neither the left’s
fantasy of <em>==a plus-size Norway==</em> nor the right’s of a return
to the <em>==isolationist==</em> 1920s. The U.S. is far too big, strong,
and <em>==messianic==</em> for voluntary diminish ment. The choice for
this <em>==superpower==</em> is between <em>==enlightened==</em>
<em>==selfinterest==</em> , with all its blind spots and failures, and
raw coercion.</p>
<p>Trump is showing what raw coercion looks like. Rather than negotiate
with Canada and Mexico, impose U.S. demands with tariffs; rather than
strengthen NATO, undermine it and threaten a conflict with one of its
smallest, most <em>==benign==</em> member countries; rather than review
aid programs for their <em>==efficacy==</em> , shut them down,
<em>==slander==</em> the people who make them work, and shrug at the
humanitarian catastrophe that follows. The deeper reason for the
extinction event at USAID is Trump’s contempt for anything that looks
like cooperation between the strong and the weak. “America First” is
more <em>==imperialist==</em> than isolationist, which is why William
McKinley, not George Washington or John Quincy Adams, is Donald Trump’s
new presidential hero. He’s using a techno-futurist billionaire to
return America to the late 19th century, when the civil service was a
patronage network and great-power doctrine held that “might makes
right.” He’s ridding himself and the country of restraining codes— the
rule of law at home, the rules-based order abroad—and replacing them
with a simple test: “What’s in it for me?” He’s
<em>==unilaterally==</em> <em>==disarming==</em> America of its soft
power, making the United States no different from China, Russia, or
Iran. This is why the <em>==gutting==</em> of USAID has received
propaganda assistance and glowing reviews from Beijing, Moscow, and
Tehran.</p>
<p><em>==Transactional==</em> logic has an obvious appeal.
<em>==Dispensing==</em> with the annoying <em>==niceties==</em> of
multilateral partnerships and foreign aid brings a kind of clarity to
international relations, showing where the real muscle is, like <em>==a
strip-down==</em> before a wrestling match. Set loose, the U.S. might be
strong enough to work its will on weaker friends and neighbors, or at
least claim to do so. Trump’s threat of tariffs to intimidate Colombia
into allowing <em>==deportation==</em> flights to land there was like
the assault on USAID—an easy demonstration project. His domination of
the propaganda sphere allows him to convince the public of victories
even where, as with Canada, there was never much of a dispute to begin
with. If NATO dissolved while the U.S. grabbed Greenland, many Americans
would regard it as a net win: We’d save money and gain a strategic chunk
of the North Atlantic while freeing ourselves of an obligation whose
benefit to us wasn’t entirely clear.</p>
<p>It isn’t obvious why funding the education of oppressed Burmese
students serves our national interest. It’s easier to see the advantages
of strongarming weak countries into giving in to our demands. If this
creates <em>==resentment==</em> , well, who said gratitude mattered
between nations? Strength has its own attractive force. A sizable
<em>==cohort==</em> of Americans have made their peace with Trump, not
because he tempered his cruelty and checked his abuses but because he is
at the height of his power and is using it without restraint. This is
called power worship. The Russian invasion of Ukraine won Vladimir Putin
a certain admiration in countries of the global South, as well as among
MAGA Americans, while Joe Biden’s appeals to democratic values seemed
<em>==pallid==</em> and hypocritical. The law of “might makes right” is
the political norm in most countries. Trump needs no explaining in
Nigeria or India.</p>
<p>Coercion also depends on the American people’s
<em>==shortsightedness==</em> and <em>==incuriosity==</em> .Trump’s
flood of executive orders and Musk’s assault on the federal government
are intended to create such chaos that not even the insiders most
affected understand what’s happening. An inattentive public might simply
see a Washington melee—the disrupters against the bureaucrats. Short of
going to war, if the U.S. starts behaving like the great powers of
earlier centuries and the rival powers of our own, how many Americans
will notice a difference in their own lives?</p>
<p><strong>According to Rubio</strong>, the purpose of the aid pause is
to weed out programs that don’t advance “core national interests.”
Gawande compared the process to stopping a plane in midair and firing
the crew in order to conduct a review of the airline industry. But the
light of the <em>==bonfire==</em> burning in Washington makes it easier
to see how soft power actually works—how most aid programs do serve the
national interest. Shutting down African health programs makes
monitoring the recent outbreak of Ebola in Uganda, and preventing its
spread from that region to the rest of the world, nearly impossible. In
many countries, the end of aid opens the door wider to
<em>==predatory==</em> Chinese loans and propaganda. As one USAID
official explained: “My job literally was countering China, providing
development assistance in a much nicer, kinder, partnership way to local
people who were being pressured and had their arms twisted.” When 70
Afghan students in central Asia, mostly women, had their scholarships to
American universities suddenly suspended and in some cases their plane
tickets canceled, the values of freedom and open inquiry lost a bit of
their attractiveness. The American college administrator responsible for
the students told me, “Young people who are sympathetic to the United
States and share our best values are not only not being welcomed;
they’re having the door slammed in their faces.”</p>
<p>Most Americans don’t want to believe that their government is taking
life saving medicine away from sick people in Africa, or betraying
Afghans who sacrificed for this country. They might disapprove of
foreign aid, but they want starving children to be fed. This native
<em>==generosity==</em> explains why Trump and Musk have gone to such
lengths to <em>==clog==</em> the internet with falsehoods and hide the
consequences of their cruelty. The only obstacle to ending American soft
power isn’t Congress, the bureaucracy, or the courts, but public
opinion.</p>
<p>One of the country’s most popular programs is the resettlement of
refugees. For decades, ordinary American citizens have welcomed the
world’s most <em>==persecuted==</em> and desperate people—European Jews
after World War II, Vietnamese after the fall of <em>==Saigon==</em> ,
Afghans after the fall of Kabul. Refugees are in a separate category
from most immigrants: After years of waiting and <em>==vetting==</em> by
U.S. and international agencies, they come here legally, with local
sponsors. But Trump and his adviser Stephen Miller see them as no
different from migrants crossing the southern border. The flurry of
executive orders and memos has halted the processing of all refugees and
ended funding for resettlement. The story has received little
attention.</p>
<p>Here’s what the program’s shutdown means: I spoke with an Afghan
special-forces captain who served alongside Americans— when Kabul was
about to fall in 2021, he prevented armed Taliban at the airport from
seizing U.S. weaponry, but he was left behind during the evacuation.</p>
<p>Arrested by the new regime, the captain was imprisoned for seven
months and suffered regular and severe torture, including the
<em>==amputation==</em> of a <em>==testicle==</em> . He managed to
escape with his family to Pakistan in 2023 and was near the end of being
processed as a refugee when Trump took office. He had heard Trump
criticize the Biden administration for leaving military equipment behind
in Afghanistan. Because he had worked to prevent that from happening, he
told me, “that gave me a hope that the new administration would value my
work and look at me as a valuable person, a person who is aligned with
all the administration is hoping to achieve, and that would give a
chance for my kids and family to be moved out safely.” Biden’s
<em>==ineptitude==</em> <em>==stranded==</em> the captain once;</p>
<p>Trump’s <em>==coldheartedness==</em> is doing it again.</p>
<p>A sense of loyalty and compassion isn’t <em>==extraneous==</em> to
American identity; it is at the core of national pride, and its betrayal
exacts a cost that can’t be easily measured. The Biden administration
created a program called Welcome Corps that allows ordinary Americans to
act as resettlement agencies. (My wife and I participated in it.) In
Pennsylvania, a retiree named Chuck Pugh formed a sponsor group to bring
an Afghan family here, and the final medical exam was completed just
before Inauguration Day. When resettlement was abruptly ended, Pugh
found himself wondering, Who are we? I know what I want to think, but
I’m just not sure. The sponsor group includes Pugh’s sister, Virginia
Mirra. She and her husband are <em>==devout==</em> Christians and
<em>==ardent==</em> Trump supporters. In early February, when I asked
her how she felt about the suspension of the refugee program, she
sounded surprised, and disappointed—she hadn’t heard the news. “I feel
sad about that,” she said. “It does bother me. It’s starting to sink in.
With these people in danger, I would wonder if there would be an
exception made for them. How would we go about that?” Her husband
frequently sends American-flag lapel pins to Trump, and I suggested that
he write the president about the Afghan family. “I will talk to my
husband tonight,” Mirra said. “And I will continue to pray that the Lord
will protect them and bring them to this country by some means. I do
believe in miracles.”</p>

id="nasas-first-software-engineer-margaret-hamilton---matt-porter-and-margaret-hamilton">NASA’s
first software engineer: Margaret Hamilton - Matt Porter and Margaret
Hamilton</h2>
<p>At roughly 4 PM on July 20, 1969, <em>==mankind was just minutes away
from landing on the surface of the moon==</em> .</p>
<p>But before the astronauts began their final <em>==descent==</em> , an
emergency alarm lit up.</p>
<p>Something was <em>==overloading==</em> the computer and threatened to
<em>==abort the landing==</em> .</p>
<p>Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton held her breath.</p>
<p>She’d led the team developing the pioneering in-flight software, so
she knew this mission <em>==had no room for error==</em> .</p>
<p>But the <em>==nature==</em> of this last-second emergency would soon
prove her software was working exactly as planned.</p>
<p>Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, Hamilton had always been
<em>==inquisitive==</em> .</p>
<p>In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy before taking a
research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay
for grad school.</p>
<p>Here, she encountered her first computer while developing software to
support research into the new field of chaos theory.</p>
<p>Next, at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software for
America’s first <em>==air defense system==</em> to search for enemy
aircraft.</p>
<p>But when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking
for help sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his
team.</p>
<p>NASA <em>==looked to==</em> Draper and his group of over 400
engineers to invent the first <em>==compact==</em> digital flight
computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer.</p>
<p>Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible for
guiding, navigating, and controlling the spacecraft.</p>
<p>At a time when unreliable computers filled entire rooms, the AGC
needed to operate without any errors and <em>==fit in one cubic foot of
space==</em> .</p>
<p>Draper divided the lab into two teams: one for designing hardware and
one for developing software.</p>
<p>Hamilton led the team that built the <em>==on-board==</em> flight
software for <em>==both the Command and Lunar Modules==</em> .</p>
<p>This work, for which she <em>==coined==</em> the term “software
engineering,” was incredibly <em>==high stakes==</em> .</p>
<p><em>==Human lives were on the line==</em> , so every program had to
be perfect.</p>
<p>Margaret’s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and
recover from them in real time.</p>
<p>But this kind of adaptable program was difficult to build, since
early software could only process jobs in a <em>==predetermined==</em>
order.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program to be “
<em>==asynchronous==</em> ,” meaning the software’s more important jobs
would interrupt less important ones.</p>
<p>Her team assigned every task a unique priority to ensure that each
job occurred in the correct order and at the right time—regardless of
any surprises.</p>
<p>After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software could help
the astronauts work in an <em>==asynchronous==</em> environment as
well.</p>
<p>She designed <em>==Priority Displays==</em> that would interrupt
astronauts’ regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies.</p>
<p>The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to
determine the best path forward.</p>
<p>This marked the first time flight software communicated directly—and
asynchronously—with a pilot.</p>
<p>It was these <em>==fail-safes==</em> that triggered the alarms just
before the lunar landing.</p>
<p>Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake—he’d
<em>==inadvertently==</em> flipped the <em>==rendezvous==</em> radar
switch.</p>
<p>This radar would be essential on their journey home, but here it was
using up vital computational resources.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage
this.</p>
<p>During the overload, the software restart programs allowed only the
highest priority jobs to be processed—including the programs necessary
for landing.</p>
<p>The Priority Displays gave the astronauts a choice: to land or not to
land.</p>
<p>With minutes to spare, Mission Control gave the order.</p>
<p>The Apollo 11 landing was about the astronauts, Mission Control,
software, and hardware all working together as an integrated system of
systems.</p>
<p>Hamilton’s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and
scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s goal to reach the
Moon.</p>
<p>And her life-saving work <em>==went far beyond==</em> Apollo 11—no
bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any crewed Apollo
missions.</p>
<p>After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses its
unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs for systems
and software.</p>
<p>In 2003, NASA honored her achievements with the largest financial
award they’d ever given to an individual.</p>
<p>And 47 years after her software first guided astronauts to the moon,
Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the
way we think about technology. # Vocabulary, Phrases and Sentences</p>

<p>One of the odder coincidences of physical geography is the fact that
there are two double islands, roughly the same size, positioned at each
other’s antipodes, or farthest-distant point. The islands of England and
Ireland in the Northern Hemisphere and the islands of North Island and
South Island in the southern Hemisphere are just such a coincidence. The
first two islands comprise the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland (or Eire), and the second two islands comprise New Zealand.
Among these four islands, there can be no doubt that South Island is the
least polluted and most spectacularly scenic of them all.</p>
<p>There is much competition to make such a claim. The island of
England, politically constituting England, Scotland, and Wales of the
United Kingdom, is dotted with country villages set alongside rivers and
lakes. There are not very tall but nonetheless rugged mountains in the
north, and endless miles of rocky coastline that seem mystical. Ireland,
too, is a paradise of greenery, with far fewer people than populous
England and even more quaint villages scattered among its low-lying
hills and forever green fields. North Island in New Zealand sports a
balmy climate and the beaches to make use of it; one beach alone is more
than 150 kilometers long and with relatively few people on its shores,
one can pretend one is at the very end of the earth. Volcanoes, large
lakes, and quickly flowing rivers traverse the land. Given the beauty of
these three islands, what makes South Island so special?</p>
<p>Plenty. For those who like mountains, South Island is sure to please.
Mt. Cook at 3764 meters is its highest peak, with 16 others above 3000
meters. Naturally, many local and foreign mountain climbers come here
for the challenge of these Southern Alps. In addition, there is an
extensive glacier system, endless forests, and innumerable lakes
throughout this highland area. Some of the world’s best mountain scenery
is available within the 500-kilometer long chain of the Southern
Alps.</p>
<p>Perhaps you prefer the sea? South Island is not only an island, but
many tiny islets can be found off its coastline. Great deep-sea fishing,
scuba diving, and snorkeling can be had, though the waters here are
cooler than those of North Island. (Remember, in the Southern
Hemisphere, as we go north, it gets warmer.)As fewer people live on
South Island than on North Island, those who crave solitude and pristine
beaches will be amazed at their luck here. With almost no heavy industry
on South Island, the air, water, and land are all free of pollution. The
Local seafood is therefore clean, plentiful, and never-ending.</p>
<p>Do healthful climates interest you? South Island is the place to be.
Its temperate climate sees little snow except in the highlands and
mountainous areas. Like Ireland and England, there are no extremes of
temperature, either. Summers are warm, not hot, and winters are brisk
rather than freezing. The fresh air is sometimes humid from the abundant
rainfall of this area. Every season invites the nature lover to get out
and be active in the countryside.</p>
<p>Of course, South Island is not for everyone. For those who need busy,
crowded, noisy, and polluted cities, this Southern outpost will surely
disappoint. For those who enjoy pressure and stress, South Island will
leave them empty-handed. And for those who would rather stay at home or
in an office in front of a computer screen or in the thumping,
smoke-filled dance floors of discos, some of the world’s best natural
scenery will never entice them away. For the rest of us, though, South
Island is the world’s best kept secret. If Nature’s paradise sounds
alluring, make a point of visiting South Island.</p>

<p>自然地理中一个较为奇特的巧合是，世界上存在着两组大小相近的双岛，它们分别位于彼此的对映点，也就是地球的两极。北半球的英格兰和爱尔兰群岛以及南半球的新西兰南北二岛就是这样的巧合。前两者构成了联合王国和爱尔兰共和国，后两者则组成了新西兰。在这四个岛屿中，南岛无疑是污染最少且风景最为秀丽的。</p>
<p>对于谁才是风景最秀丽的岛屿，各方竞争激烈。政治上构成英国的英格兰岛，遍布着点缀在河流和湖泊之畔的乡村。北部有虽不高耸却崎岖的山脉，以及绵延无尽、神秘莫测的岩石海岸线。爱尔兰也是一片绿意盎然的乐土，人口远少于人口密集的英格兰，其低洼的丘陵和终年翠绿的田野间散布着更多古雅的村落。新西兰的北岛气候宜人，还有诸多可供享受的海滩；仅一个海滩就长达150多公里，而且海岸线上人相对较少，让人仿佛置身于世界尽头。岛上有火山、大湖泊和湍急的河流。鉴于这三个岛屿的美丽，那么南岛究竟有何特别之处呢？</p>
<p>特别之处可多了。对于喜爱山脉的人来说，南岛绝对会让他们心满意足。库克山海拔3764米，是其最高峰，还有另外16座山峰海拔超过3000米。自然而然地，许多国内外的登山者都来到这里挑战南阿尔卑斯山脉。此外，这片高地地区还有广阔的冰川系统、无垠的森林和无数的湖泊。在长达500公里的南阿尔卑斯山脉中，能领略到一些世界上最棒的山地风光。</p>
<p>或许你更喜欢大海？南岛不仅是一个岛屿，其海岸线外还有许多小岛屿。这里有绝佳的深海捕鱼、水肺潜水和浮潜条件，尽管这里的海水比北岛的海水更凉爽。（记住，在南半球，越往北走，气候越温暖。）由于南岛的人口比北岛少，那些渴望独处和纯净海滩的人会在这里惊喜地发现自己运气真好。南岛几乎没有重工业，空气、水和土地都没有污染。因此，当地的海鲜干净、丰富且源源不断。</p>
<p>有益健康的气候吸引你吗？南岛就是这样的地方。除了高地和山区，这里气候温和，降雪很少。和爱尔兰、英格兰一样，这里也没有极端的气温。夏天温暖但不炎热，冬天凉爽但不寒冷。这片地区充沛的降雨有时会让新鲜空气变得湿润。每个季节都吸引着热爱大自然的人到户外去，在乡村尽情活动。</p>
<p>当然，南岛并非适合所有人。对于那些需要繁忙、拥挤、嘈杂和污染城市的人来说，这个南方前哨肯定会让他们失望。对于那些喜欢压力和紧张的人来说，南岛也不会给他们带来满足感。而对于那些宁愿待在家里或办公室对着电脑屏幕，或者在迪斯科舞厅震耳欲聋、烟雾弥漫的舞池里的人来说，世界上一些最棒的自然风光永远无法吸引他们离开。然而，对于我们其余的人来说，南岛是世界上最隐秘的瑰宝。如果大自然的天堂听起来很诱人，一定要去游览一下南岛。</p>

<p>Bridget Jones, as a character, has always hovered uncomfortably
between <em>==the hard light of reality and the rosy glow of
romance==</em> . When she first appeared, in newspaper columns written
by the British journalist Helen Fielding during the mid-1990s, the 30-
something Bridget was claimed as a <em>==totem==</em> of woman
<em>==hood==</em> at the time: a calorie-counting,
self-improvement-obsessed, chain-smoking, <em>==wine-guzzling
singleton==</em> (a <em>==neologism==</em> Fielding
<em>==immortalized==</em> ); an <em>==earnest==</em> <em>==vassal==</em>
of <em>Cosmo</em> culture and the embodiment of
<em>==fearmongering==</em> Newsweek coverage about the plight of
unmarried career girls. With Bridget, Fielding “articulated the traumas
of a generation,” the writer Alain de Botton observed.</p>
<p>But when Bridget’s diary <em>==entries==</em> were published in book
form, in 1996, her true narrative <em>==arc==</em> was revealed. It
didn’t chart a postmodern Gen X nightmare. It was lovingly
<em>==cribbed==</em> from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. The most
notorious single woman of an era, as her fans learned in the book and
its 1999 <em>==sequel==</em> , and from the movies they inspired in 2001
and 2004, would be largely protected by the <em>==tired==</em> old
<em>==trappings==</em> of the marriage plot: She would <em>==bag==</em>
her Mr. Darcy and live happily ever after—with a few
<em>==detours==</em> —in his <em>==dreamy==</em> <em>==detached==</em>
house in Holland Park.</p>
<p>Her <em>==trajectory==</em> over the next decade-plus (in another
round of newspaper columns; another book; and a third movie, Bridget
Jones’s Baby, in 2016, not based on a book) certainly had its
<em>==requisite==</em> <em>==stumbles==</em> . But the character was
<em>==steadied==</em> throughout by the <em>==Texan==</em> actor Renée
Zellweger as the very English Bridget, an unpredictably brilliant piece
of <em>==casting==</em> that just works.</p>
<p>On paper, Bridget can be <em>==compellingly==</em> hard to <em>==pin
down==</em> , <em>==inconstant==</em> and <em>==ironic==</em> ,
<em>==messily self-aware==</em> , undeniably human. Early on, she
<em>==cops==</em> to highly compromised feminist principles: She will
not “ <em>==sulk==</em> about having no boyfriend, but develop inner
<em>==poise==</em> and authority and sense of self as woman of
substance, complete <em>without</em> boyfriend, as best way to obtain
boyfriend.” On-screen, though, Zellweger makes her all heart,
<em>==guileless==</em> as a <em>==toddler==</em> , impossibly hopeful
and <em>==lovably==</em> absurd. Whatever cards she’s dealt—not least
professional <em>==humiliation==</em> and an accidental pregnancy
(paternity unclear, thanks to separate one-night stands and a box of
expired <em>==eco-friendly condoms==</em> )—she <em>==muddles==</em>
through with <em>==gusto==</em> . We know that Bridget will get her
happy ending; this is just about the last romantic-comedy
<em>==franchise==</em> standing. But Zellweger makes us also deeply want
her to win, formulaic predictability be damned.</p>
<p><em>Bridget Jones</em>: Mad About the Boy, an adaptation of the
<em>==slapdash==</em> third novel that starts <em>==streaming==</em> on
Peacock on February 13, keeps the <em>==trope-laden structure==</em> ,
but finds surprising depth in a devastating plot twist. Bridget, now in
her 50s, is single once again: Her beloved husband, Mark Darcy (played
in grand <em>==metafictional==</em> form by an actor who played the
other Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth), has died while on a
<em>==humanitarian==</em> mission in Sudan, leaving Bridget to raise
their two children alone. The book uses Mark’s death mostly as a
narrative device to launch Bridget, with her typically obsessive energy,
into <em>==cougardom==</em> : She starts dating a <em>==hunky==</em> man
in his late 20s named— <em>==inanely==</em> —Roxster, which exposes
Bridget to a whole new range of body-image issues, and exposes Roxster
to her children’s head <em>==lice==</em> .</p>
<p>The movie, though, is more interested in documenting Bridget’s loss,
and in the process, it presents a more honest and moving version of her
than we’ve seen before. <em>How will the last cockeyed optimist in
popular culture deal with such desolation?</em> <em>==Widowhood==</em>
is no laughing matter, parenting alone even less so—though we have to
laugh at Bridget burying her face in the <em>==fridge==</em> to curse,
and being surprised by her son’s <em>==uptight==</em> science teacher
while buying an astonishing variety of <em>==contraceptives==</em> .
<em>==Pathos==</em> <em>==underpins==</em> the plot. “Do you miss Dada
sometimes?” Mabel, Bridget’s daughter, asks her in the movie. “I miss
him all of the times,” Bridget replies.</p>
<p><em>==Grief==</em> is a tough sell for a <em>==rom-com==</em> , which
is maybe why the movie has marketed itself as something more timely,
once again positioning Bridget as representative of her moment. Cinema
lately has been consumed with what viewers call the “ <em>==age-gap
romance==</em> ,” or, less <em>==decorously==</em> , the “MILF setup.”
In 2024’s <em>The Idea of You</em>, Anne Hathaway plays a
<em>divorcée</em> not unlike Bridget in her <em>==ditziness==</em> , who
<em>==careens==</em> her way into a love affair with a handsome British
<em>==boy-bander==</em> . In two separate movie projects within the
space of a year, <em>A Family Affair</em> and <em>Babygirl</em>, Nicole
Kidman <em>==parses==</em> the power differentials at play when older
women find <em>==fulfillment==</em> with younger men.</p>
<p>Bridget’s adventures with the age gap are characteristically sweet
and <em>==laced==</em> with <em>==goofiness==</em> : When she meets
Roxster, she’s shinnying up a tree that both of her children have
managed to get stuck in. When he later messages her on Tinder, it’s via
an account that her friends have set up: “Tragic Widow Seeks Sexual
Awakening.” <em>==Mortification==</em> , for Bridget, is only ever a
degree or two removed from triumph.</p>
<p><em>Yet Mad About the Boy</em>, for all its familiar, delightful
notes, is also <em>==wincingly==</em> <em>==astute==</em> regarding
modernday dynamics, good and bad, for women of Bridget’s age. When her
friends encourage her to pursue Roxster, the idea is plausible not just
because Zellweger is still <em>==luminously==</em>
<em>==endearing==</em> in <em>==midlife==</em> , but because the world
really has changed: Women can date men a decade or more younger
<em>==without inciting mass hysteria==</em> . But they’ve remained
undesirable in other ways: Bridget works as a producer for a daytime TV
show where formerly <em>==hard-hitting==</em> female news reporters now
<em>==gush==</em> their way through <em>==cooking segments==</em> and
<em>==softball interviews==</em> . For female journalists over a certain
age, “HDTV was an <em>==extinction-level==</em> event,” Bridget’s friend
Talitha <em>==mutters==</em> .</p>
<p>The tension between sharp contemporary <em>==verisimilitude==</em>
and <em>==age-old romantic archetype==</em> helps explain why Bridget
<em>==potters==</em> on while so many other ’90s heroines have fallen by
the wayside. (Remember Ally McBeal? She of the <em>==miniskirts==</em>
and the <em>==catfights==</em> and the <em>==ludicrous==</em> workplace
dilemmas?) The book version of Bridget has come in for
<em>==derision==</em> as an embarrassing relic of
<em>==postfeminism==</em> , screwing up even the most basic personal and
professional tasks, and fixated on her thigh <em>==circumference==</em>
and her office crushes. In 2023, a <em>New York Times</em> retrospective
finally declared her “ <em>==nuttiness==</em> and
<em>==self-loathing==</em> ” to be well past its expiration date for
modern readers. Yet her movie comebacks continue to be irresistible, in
part because no one is more aware of her failings than Bridget
herself.</p>
<p>Crucially, she never lets her <em>==self-critique==</em> shake a
confidence lodged someplace inside her (even if she’s not quite sure
where). The academic Kelly A. Marsh has argued that despite her
<em>==ongoing==</em> preoccupation with becoming better, Bridget at her
core represents, through all her phases, the victory of self-acceptance.
She flourishes not just because of the love stories that the novels’
framing forces on her, but thanks to the faithful love of her friends
and her own <em>==stouthearted==</em> spirit.</p>
<p>There’s something <em>==poignant==</em> , too, about seeing Zellweger
in the role, despite all the <em>==indignities==</em> the actor has
suffered along the way—the 2000 cover shoot for <em>Harper’s
Bazaar</em>, rudely shelved because Zellweger had gained weight for the
role and was deemed too fat for a fashion magazine; the
<em>==tabloid==</em> coverage declaring her “ <em>==scary skinny==</em>
” when she then duly dieted; the discourse about her changing face, so
rabid and intrusive that she had to strike it down in a personal essay
for <em>HuffPost</em>. At 55, Zellweger is in what Germaine
<em>==Greer==</em> once cited as a decade of new “invisibility” for
women—a phenomenon that Bridget herself analyzes in her diary. And yet
here they both are: <em>==undaunted==</em> , blond, adorable, enduring,
changing the world by refusing to <em>==shrink away from it==</em> .
That, as Bridget might say, is v.v. good to see.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2022, I was 36 years old and jumping up and down in
my bathroom, trying to <em>==figure out==</em> my future. I had ordered
<em>==a fertility test==</em> online that said it would provide fast
results with just a few drops of blood. The videos on the company’s
website featured a smiling blond woman jumping—to stimulate blood flow,
naturally—and then <em>==e­ffortlessly==</em> <em>==dribbling==</em>
blood from her nger tips all over a little strip of test paper. All I
had to do was be like her. Joyful. <em>==Sanguineous==</em> .
Fertile.</p>
<p>For years, my husband, Rich, and I had <em>==gingerly==</em> walked
the prime <em>==meridian==</em> between wanting and not wanting kids,
usually leaning toward the “no” side. Having a baby had seemed un a­
ordable and impossible. On days when I nished work at 8 p.m., the
thought of <em>==procreating==</em> made me laugh, then
<em>==shudder==</em> .</p>
<p>Recently, though, I’d begun to reconsider. I was in the midst of an
<em>==admittedly==</em> strange-sounding project: I was spending a year
trying to change my personality. According to a scientific personality
test I’d taken, I scored sky-high on <em>==neuroticism==</em> , a trait
associated with anxiety and depression, and low on
<em>==agreeable==</em> <em>==ness==</em> and <em>==extroversion==</em> .
I lived in a constant, <em>==clenched==</em> state of dread, and it was
poisoning my life. My therapist had stopped laughing at my jokes.</p>
<p>But I had read some scientific research suggesting that you can
change your personality by behaving like the kind of person you wish you
were. Several studies show that people who want to be, say, less
isolated or less anxious can make a habit of socializing, meditating, or
journaling. Eventually these habits will come naturally,
<em>==knitting==</em> together to form new traits.</p>
<p>I knew that becoming a parent had the potential to change me in even
more profound ways. But I had no idea how. My own mother once said to
me, “I can’t picture you as a mother.” The truth was, neither could
I.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure I could get pregnant, even if I wanted to. My age put
me in a category that was, in a less delicate time, called “
<em>==geriatric==</em> ” for pregnancy, and one doctor told me my eggs
were probably of “poor quality.” The fertility test I’d ordered was
meant to determine if those eggs were <em>==serviceable==</em> . In the
bathroom, I unwrapped the <em>==glossy==</em> white box. The
instructions said the test would take 20 minutes and require a pack of
<em>==lancets==</em> . I grabbed one and <em>==stabbed==</em> it into my
geriatric forefinger. Two hours, five lancets, and a
<em>==graveyard==</em> of <em>==gauze==</em> and alcohol wipes later, I
still hadn’t squeezed a single <em>==droplet==</em> out of my finger.
Was I not jumping high enough? Was I already failing as a mother?</p>
<p>I was worried I wouldn’t be able to have a baby. I was also scared to
death of having one.</p>
<p><strong>Arguably, many things</strong> are wrong with me. I was
raised by Russian immigrants who constantly worried that the “
<em>==dark day==</em> ” was upon us, so hopeful thoughts about the
future of humanity don’t come naturally. I’m not a person who is a­ ected
by cuteness. I’ve never liked holding—or even really looking at—other
people’s babies. I don’t like animals. I couldn’t imagine
<em>==cooing==</em> and smiling at a baby as much as science says you’re
supposed to for their brain development.</p>
<p>My neuroticism made it especially hard to decide if I wanted kids,
because no process is more <em>==rife==</em> with uncertainty than
parenting, and nothing scares anxious people more than uncertainty. I
worried that Rich and I would ght more, and that our relationship would
su­ er. I worried about sleep <em>==deprivation==</em> . I felt
<em>==torn==</em> between my lifelong conviction that people shouldn’t
create problems for themselves and my (apparent) desire to do just
that.</p>
<p>I would wake up in the middle of the night and Google things like
<em>percent ==miscarriage== pregnant while 36?; anxiety pregnancy
miscarriage causes; Diet Coke fetal defects; pregnancy brain stops
working hands stop working</em>. These searches surfaced
<em>==horrific==</em> <em>==anecdotes==</em> , but never any conclusive
answers about what I should do. One time, I Googled reasons to have kids
and found an article that labeled all the reasons I had come up
with—like being cared for in old age and having someone who loves
me—with the heading “Not-So-Good Reasons to Have Children.”</p>
<p>But then I would remember the times we visited Rich’s mom, who had
<em>==dementia==</em> , in her nursing home. <em>==Her face lit up at
the sight of him==</em> . “My son, my son, my only son,” she’d say,
grabbing his arm. He was the only person she still recognized. The
visits were a reminder that the people who matter most at the end are
your children. The readers of your blog posts won’t make the trip.</p>
<p>Heather Rackin, a sociologist at Louisiana State University, found in
a study that the death of a mother or sibling increased the likelihood
that a woman would give birth within two years. The e proximity of death
is, perhaps, <em>==a wake-up call==</em> . Who will remember us? The
study was based on Rackin’s personal experience: When her father died in
2017, she decided not to wait any longer to have kids. His death got her
thinking, she told me, about what was important in life: the experience
of being loved and the chance to provide that love for someone else. Her
rst child was born in 2019.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to postpone or avoid having children— the
cost, the responsibility, <em>==the existence of and use case for the
NoseFrida==</em> . But in addition to the practical challenges, a
narrative has taken hold: Everything changes when you become a
mother.</p>
<p>Once they reach their 30s, many people have carefully cultivated
friend groups and <em>==sourdough==</em> starters and five-year plans.
They “really have a good sense of who they are, and then having a baby
totally disrupts everything that they thought they knew about
themselves,” says Lauren Ratli  , a <em>==perinatal==</em> therapist in
Illinois. Of course, this is where I di  er from the rest of my
<em>==cohort==</em> . By the time I was ready to have a baby, I’d
already been trying to disrupt everything about myself.</p>
<p>For my personality-change project, I had experimented with science-
backed strategies to turn down my neuroticism and <em>==amp==</em> up my
<em>==extroversion==</em> and <em>==agreeableness==</em> . I had spent
hundreds of hours trying out different <em>==iterations==</em> of
<em>==mindfulness==</em> , culminating in a day-long meditation retreat
that almost killed me with boredom but somehow <em>==alleviated==</em>
my depression. Among other agreeableness-boosting activities, I traveled
to London for a “conversation workshop,” where I learned techniques that
can make even British people show an emotion. And to become more
extroverted, I went out as much as humanly possible. I played table
tennis. I did <em>==improv==</em> , and survived.</p>
<p>For the most part, my efforts worked: I no longer thought of talking
with people as a waste of time. I became less afraid of uncertainty and
disappointment. I made one very good new friend. I drank less.</p>
<p>I had been changing, but it was a type of change that I directly
determined. I could go to happy hour, or not. I could meditate, or stop.
I was aware that <em>==parenthood==</em> would <em>==transform me
further==</em> , but what I found unsettling was that I couldn’t know
exactly how. Bizarrely, for the biggest disruption of your life, study
after study shows there’s no “typical” way that becoming a parent
changes your personality. Some studies have found tiny average decreases
in extroversion or openness among new parents— but even those findings
aren’t consistent.</p>
<p>Despite my progress, I was still too <em>==neurotic==</em> to feel
comfortable <em>==surrendering==</em> control and letting biology
<em>==mold==</em> me into someone I couldn’t predict and might not
recognize.</p>
<p><strong>After doctors pronounced</strong> me insufficiently fertile,
Rich and I decided to just stop being careful one month and see what
happened. We figured we would at least have some fun before we
<em>==embarked==</em> on our <em>==arduous==</em> “fertility
journey.”</p>
<p>A short time later, on a <em>==choppy==</em> boat tour in Europe, I
couldn’t stop <em>==leaning over==</em> the edge of the
<em>==catamaran==</em> and <em>==hurling==</em> .</p>
<p>“Do you think you might be pregnant?” Rich whispered <em>==as the
boat crew force-fed me pita bread==</em> .</p>
<p>“Don’t be <em>==insane==</em> ,” I said. Everyone knows that
37-year-olds— especially infertile ones—don’t get pregnant on their
first try.</p>
<p>A week after that, I found out that I had indeed gotten pregnant on
my first try.</p>
<p>Being pregnant means having your brain replaced with an anxiety
T-shirt cannon. I didn’t feel <em>==glowy==</em> or
<em>==goddessy==</em> ; I felt crazy. None of my friends has kids, and
many of them reacted to my news like I’d gotten a face
<em>==tattoo==</em> . One sent me a TikTok of everything that can
<em>==supposedly==</em> go wrong in pregnancy, including the possibility
that <em>==vomit==</em> will come out of your eyes. (It won’t.) I spent
more and more time by myself, obsessing over which <em>==swaddles==</em>
were best. (We didn’t end up using any.)</p>
<p>Thanks to <em>==a king tide of hormones==</em> ,
<em>==irritability==</em> <em>==spikes==</em> during the first and last
<em>==trimesters==</em> of pregnancy. People say your baby will remember
the sounds they hear in the <em>==womb==</em> , but I fear mine detected
little in there other than me screaming at his father. Every few weeks,
something would <em>==set me off==</em> , at a deafening volume. If
they’d <em>==overheard==</em> me, those couples therapists who say
<em>==contempt==</em> is the most glaring sign of a failed relationship
would probably have advised us to start <em>==divvying==</em> up our
furniture.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I was yelling, being so mean felt amazing— as though
I’d finally <em>==engulfed==</em> Rich in my distress. <em>Obviously you
need a travel ==stroller==</em> and <em>a regular stroller!</em> I
always apologized, and Rich always accepted my apology. But one time he
said, “You know that with a kid, <em>==that’s not really something you
can take back, right?==</em> ” Sometimes, late at night, after yet
another argument, I would rotate my <em>==spheroid==</em> belly toward
Rich and ask, “What if I turn out to be a bad mother?”</p>
<p>The rest of the pregnancy was horrible. I didn’t think it was
possible to feel so tired and still be technically alive. At my baby
shower, when some friends asked me how I was feeling, I quoted the
Russian <em>==dissident==</em> Boris Nadezhdin responding to a question
about whether he feared <em>==imprisonment==</em> or death: “The
<em>==tastiest==</em> and the sweetest years of my life are already in
the past.” (This is is the closest Russians get to excited.)</p>
<p>Three weeks before my due date, after a routine ultrasound, my
high-risk ob-gyn walked briskly into the room. She looked around for
something to sit on and, finding nothing, <em>==plopped down on top of a
closed trash==</em> can. She told me that something was wrong with my
<em>==placenta==</em> , and that the baby was in danger. And that I
should now <em>==walk over to the delivery wing of the hospita==</em>
l.</p>
<p><em>==In the antechamber of the operating room==</em> , I
<em>==hyperventilated==</em> in my paper gown and tapped out emails to
all my sources and <em>==bosses==</em> : <em>I’m having an emergency
C-section today, so I won’t be available for the next few months</em>.
My last day of caring whether people were mad at me.</p>
<p>Afterward, while <em>==the medical residents==</em> were rearranging
my <em>==innards==</em> , I thought I heard one of them ask me
something.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s going on down there at all,” I said
across the blue curtain.</p>
<p>“That’s … probably for the best,” the resident said.</p>
<p><strong>HE CAME OUT</strong> with white hair, a perfectly round face,
and a <em>==grumpy==</em> expression, like the leader of a former
Yugoslav republic. I called him “Slobodan” a couple of times, until Rich
told me to stop.</p>
<p>Because he was early, we panic-picked a name from our shortlist—
Evan. The same day he was born, doctors <em>==whisked==</em> him away to
the <em>==NICU==</em> ; I saw him only a few times before we were all
sent home days later. My <em>==discharge paperwork==</em> said, “Mom is
<em>==breastfeeding==</em> four or five times a day,” which was funny
because at that point I had not done it successfully even once. It was
also funny because I—quite possibly the least qualified person for the
job—was apparently “Mom.”</p>
<p>Once home, we entered the period we now refer to as “Cute Abu
Ghraib.” <em>==Sleep deprivation==</em> <em>==addled==</em> me to the
point that, on a call with the <em>==pediatrician==</em> , I forgot the
baby’s name. When Evan was two weeks old, I <em>==bit into a piece of
chicken==</em> and tasted something <em>==bloody==</em> and sharp. I had
ground my teeth so hard during his NICU stay that I’d <em>==loosened a
crown==</em> .</p>
<p>We <em>==agonized==</em> over whether the <em>==gyrations==</em> of
the SNOO Smart Sleeper Bassinet would rattle his brain too much, then
grew too exhausted to care. I became the CEO of Baby Inc., and Rich was
employee No. 1; we communicated only about <em>==ointments==</em> and
<em>==ounces==</em> . I finally had the big <em>==boobs==</em> of my
dreams, but the only man who saw them was two feet tall and couldn’t
read.</p>
<p>But then something interrupted the misery. One night, I was holding
Evan while he was sleeping. I had read that singing to your baby was
beneficial, so I decided to <em>==serenade==</em> him with one of the
few songs I know by heart: “Forever and Ever, Amen,” by Randy Travis.
Except I couldn’t seem to get through the fourth line: “This is love
that I feel for you always will be.” I, a bad bitch who has never cried
at a wedding, kept choking up.</p>
<p>Rich asked me if I was okay.</p>
<p>“Whatever!” I said, <em>==tears rolling down my cheeks==</em> . “Shut
up!”</p>
<p>I thought <em>==motherhood==</em> would be a forced march through
inert <em>==babyhood==</em> and <em>==feral==</em> <em>==toddler==</em>
years before we finally reached the golden time of my imagination:
having a talking, <em>==precocious==</em> elementary schooler. But there
I was, flooded with adoration for someone who barely registered my
presence. I’d hated being pregnant, so I thought I would hate having a
baby, too. But I loved him. I loved this.</p>
<p>Recall the research showing there’s no one way that parenthood tends
to change people’s personalities. Anecdotally, researchers told me that
they do notice certain patterns among new parents. Most moms worry about
their kid, more or less constantly, from the minute they find out
they’re pregnant. “ <em>==Signing up to be a parent is signing up to
have a lifetime of some degree of depression and anxiety==</em> ,”
Ratliff , the therapist, told me.</p>
<p>New parents’ satisfaction with their romantic relationship goes down,
especially for mothers, and especially in the first year. “ <em>==Guilt
is another universal==</em> ,” says Aurélie Athan, a clinical
psychologist at Columbia University’s Teachers College, who researches
the transition known as “ <em>==matrescence==</em> .” <em>==The creeping
sense==</em> that you should be with your kid while you’re working and
working while you’re with your kid apparently never goes away.</p>
<p>She told me that mothers become more <em>==attuned==</em> and
<em>==prosocial==</em> — more caring and empathetic toward others. Athan
said this is why so many mothers cry when their babies cry and have a
hard time watching <em>==gory==</em> movies. “Moms get a really bad
taste in their mouth with violent television or looking at images of
war,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s where she lost me. My son had <em>==colic==</em> ; for the
first four months, he screamed like the possessed unless he was within
the <em>==jiggly confines of his SNOO==</em> . The <em>==doula==</em> we
hired referred to him, alternately, as “Mr. Cheeks,” “Mr. Crab,” and,
<em>==sarcastically==</em> , “Mr. Wonderful.” If I had cried every time
he cried, I wouldn’t have had time to do anything else.</p>
<p>Eventually, Rich and I grew desensitized, or felt like we had to
match his chaotic energy with equally intense <em>==stimuli==</em> . One
night, after Evan <em>==wailed==</em> in our ears for two hours, we
shuffed downstairs and collapsed onto the couch. There was only one
thing we could think to watch that would serve as a
<em>==comedown==</em> from what had just happened: <em>Saving Private
Ryan</em>.</p>
<p>“Did you remember to <em>==sterilize==</em> the pump parts?” I asked
Rich as the <em>==entrails==</em> of American soldiers <em>==spilled
out==</em> over the beaches of Normandy.</p>
<p>“The sterilizer thing broke, so I had to reset it,” he said as a man
stumbled around <em>==with his arm blown off==</em> .</p>
<p>Even within these supposedly universal rules of parenthood, that is,
there’s a lot of variability. That’s because life events like parenthood
seem to change everyone di erently, and how you’ll change is, in part,
up to you. For a recent study, Ted Schwaba, a psychologist at Michigan
State University, and his co-authors asked thousands of Dutch people
about a life event in the past 10 years, such as a divorce or a new job,
that they felt had changed who they were as a person. About 7 percent of
the participants identified parenthood as the event that changed them,
and on average, they felt that it had made them slightly more agreeable
and <em>==conscientious==</em> .</p>
<p>But <em>==the big takeaway==</em> for Schwaba, from looking at all
the data for all the different types of life events, was that there
really was no pattern. Some people became more <em>==extroverted==</em>
when they got a new job. Some became less so. Some people actually
became less neurotic— that is, less depressed and anxious— after, say, a
cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>To Schwaba, this research suggests that it’s how you experience an
event such as parenthood, more than the event itself, that determines
how you’ll change. “The same event, like getting divorced, might be
someone’s worst thing that’s ever happened to them, and for someone
else, it might be the best thing that’s ever happened to them,” he told
me.</p>
<p>Or your personality might change not immediately after an event like
childbirth, but through a long process that the event sets in motion.
It’s not the cry you hear in <em>==the delivery room==</em> that changes
you; it’s the many years of researching child care and <em>==soothing
boo-boos==</em> that gradually turn you into someone new. To change, you
have to take steps every day to do so. Having a baby won’t make you a
better person. Behaving like a better person for your baby will.</p>
<p>Of all the things I wanted motherhood to change about me, neuroticism
was high on the list. Before I had Evan, I felt like I was personally
responsible for <em>==making life unfold perfectly==</em> , and whenever
I “failed” to do so, <em>==I had a meltdown==</em> . One day a few years
ago, I got a bad haircut, <em>==got stuck in traffic==</em> , and had
professional photos taken that looked terrible. My response to this—what
my new-parent eyes now see as an 8-out-of-10 day—was to <em>==chug half
a bottle of wine==</em> and scream to my husband through sobs, “I hate
everyone and everything!”</p>
<p>But now so much goes wrong every single day that there’s no time to
get upset about any one thing. I recently took a flight with Evan by
myself, an exercise that really underscores the first Noble Truth of
Buddhism (life is su­ ering). As I <em>==hauled==</em> the car seat, the
stroller, the baby, the diaper bag, and the <em>==trendy==</em> ,
impractical tote from my childless years to the TSA line, an airline
attendant took one look at me and said, “I know; it is too much.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the flight, I noticed that the two bottles of
formula Evan nervously drank during takeo­ had caught up with him, and
that <em>==he was now soaked with pee==</em> . I grabbed him under the
<em>==armpits==</em> and <em>==scooted==</em> across the seats to change
him in the airplane’s <em>==postage-stamp-size bathroom==</em> . With
one hand, I held him, crying, on the <em>==changing table==</em> , and
with the other, I dug a clean onesie out of the bottom of the diaper
bag. I fastened a million tiny onesie buttons. Then I saw that I had
<em>==misaligned==</em> them and fastened them again. Next it was my
turn. I couldn’t leave him on the changing table, or put him on the
disgusting floor. I <em>==yanked my leggings down==</em> and held him at
arm’s length as I <em>==peed==</em> .</p>
<p>By the end of that <em>==ordeal==</em> , I felt accomplished and
capable. I didn’t feel like sobbing; <em>==I felt like high-fiving
myself==</em> . I’ve let go in other ways, too. I show up at important
meetings without makeup on. I say weird stu­ff to strangers and don’t
analyze it obsessively later. Evan has forced me to step outside myself,
to break from the relentless self-focus that has contributed to both my
success and my unhappiness.</p>
<p>My remaining neuroses are <em>==laser-directed==</em> on his
well-being. I had initially planned not to breastfeed, but once I
started, I got so into it that when a doctor suggested that Evan would
spit up less if I cut food <em>==allergens==</em> from my diet, I
stopped eating virtually anything but oats and <em>==spinach for
months==</em> . When I was pregnant, we’d <em>==signed the unborn Evan
up for day care==</em> , but as the end of my <em>==maternity==</em>
<em>==leave loomed==</em> , I embarked on a frantic search for a
<em>==nanny==</em> so he could stay close to me while I worked from
home. I had always mentally mocked parents who checked to be sure their
babies were still breathing at night, then found myself standing in
front of his crib at 3 a.m., feeling for <em>==puffs of air from two
tiny nostrils==</em> .</p>
<p>I yell at Rich less than I used to, because not only is he employee
No. 1 of Baby Inc., but he’s the only employee, and frankly there are no
other applicants for the job. In fact, the whole experience has made me
kinder and more tender, like the Grinch, post–heart enlargement. I’m
less worried about wasting time, because all time with a baby is
essentially wasted—the most important nothing you’ll ever do in your
life. I even love Evan’s wet, violent “kisses,” which leave his
baby-teeth imprints on our jaws. When my friend Anton visited recently,
he watched me make <em>==horsey==</em> noises for Evan for what probably
felt like hours. “I can’t believe you love an infant!” he said.</p>
<p>During my interview with Ratli­ , I told her that Evan had lately been
losing interest in breastfeeding. I had awaited this day through months
of <em>==bleeding nipples and frustration==</em> , but now that it was
here, it was making me a bit sad. “Your baby’s moving to the next
stage,” she alarmed, “and this one is not going to come back again.” I
started <em>==tearing up==</em> —both at the memory of those bleary,
milk-soaked months together and at the realization that he wouldn’t even
be a baby for much longer.</p>
<p>During my personality-change experiment, my meditation teacher had
tried to hammer home the idea that “ <em>==this too shall pass==</em> ”
is both <em>==uplifting==</em> and sad: Nothing bad lasts forever, but
neither does anything good. Before I had Evan, I was focused on
<em>==impermanence==</em> ’s upsides: This uncomfortable improv show
will end; this awful pregnancy will too. But now I’m more keenly aware
of its downsides. The sleepless nights will end, but so too will the
times Evan squeals at a game of peekaboo, or spends an entire swim class
gazing up at me in awe. Every day brings a sigh of relief and a pang of
nostalgia. Having someone who loves you, I’ve decided, is a good reason
to have kids.</p>

<p>From cars to home appliances, the 20th century was
<em>==defined==</em> by mass production and readily available
<em>==interchangeable==</em> parts.</p>
<p>This made repairing items relatively easy.</p>
<p>If your shower head <em>==gasket==</em> failed or the hose for your
washing machine <em>==sprang a leak==</em> , a hardware store likely
carried replacements.</p>
<p>Today, interchangeable parts are as important as ever for mass
production.</p>
<p>However, some companies are working hard to prevent consumers from
<em>==swapping out==</em> components on their own.</p>
<p>In many cases, repair can only be done by the original manufacturer,
<em>==if at all==</em> .</p>
<p>With limited repair options available, we end up buying new and
throwing more items out.</p>
<p>This is especially true for electronics.</p>
<p>In 2022, we discarded about 62 million tons of e-waste, along with
billions of dollars’ worth of precious metals inside them.</p>
<p>So how exactly do companies prevent repair?</p>
<p>Some make it physically more difficult to fix items.</p>
<p>They can glue parts in place rather than using screws.</p>
<p>Others limit the information they share with consumers, like blocking
public access to product information and <em>==schematics==</em> .</p>
<p>During the pandemic, for instance, when hospitals struggled to
maintain breaking medical equipment, the repair company iFixit compiled
a comprehensive database of repair manuals for hospitals to use.</p>
<p><em>==Yet manufacturers like Steris fought for them to be taken
down==</em> .</p>
<p>Yet perhaps the most important, yet least obvious, way companies
limit repair is by preventing the interchangeability of parts.</p>
<p>In a process known as parts pairing, companies assign individual
parts like screens, batteries, or sensors a unique serial number.</p>
<p>The device’s internal software can then detect if those components
are replaced and limit their functionality as a result.</p>
<p>If you swap the screen on two <em>==brand==</em> new iPhones, for
example, the automatic <em>==brightness==</em> adjustment will no longer
work.</p>
<p>In other cases, unauthorized replacements can cause the device to
stop functioning altogether.</p>
<p>If a farmer uses an independent shop to repair certain parts in a
John Deere tractor, it won’t operate until a company technician
<em>==authenticates==</em> the new part using authorized software.</p>
<p>With only a limited number of company technicians available, this can
easily create a <em>==bottleneck==</em> , costing farmers precious time
and money, and even jeopardizing crops.</p>
<p>Manufacturers can also use software to give devices
<em>==predetermined==</em> <em>==end-of-life dates==</em> , after which
they no longer receive important updates and slowly become unusable.</p>
<p>All this gives manufacturers unprecedented control over the products
we buy and limits the way we repair them.</p>
<p>Critics <em>==liken==</em> these tactics to a form of planned
<em>==obsolescence==</em> , a manufacturing strategy where a product is
deliberately designed to fail to keep both demand and profits high.</p>
<p>But companies pose two main arguments in defense of these
practices.</p>
<p>First, they claim that giving consumers and third-party repair shops
access to their software could create <em>==cybersecurity==</em>
risks.</p>
<p>They also argue that they could be <em>==liable==</em> if a product
malfunctions after a third party or consumer repair.</p>
<p>A <em>==shoddy==</em> repair to a medical device, for instance, could
have deadly consequences, and the manufacturer could be blamed.</p>
<p>However, major reports, like those from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, find little support for
these company claims.</p>
<p><em>==Parts pairing and repair-limiting practices==</em> are now
being closely <em>==scrutinized==</em> in courts all over the world, as
consumers fight for the right to repair.</p>
<p>States, including Colorado and Oregon, have passed laws banning parts
pairing.</p>
<p>Community-led movements have also taken root.</p>
<p>Over 2,500 cities across the globe, from Amsterdam to Boise to
Bangalore, have established repair <em>==cafes==</em> .</p>
<p>Here, people trade and share their knowledge,
<em>==reinvigorating==</em> a culture of repair at a time when it often
feels easier to <em>==toss==</em> our things than fix them.</p>

Anglo-America</h2>
<p>“Oh, no! Here I am at an American family’s home at the dinner table.
There are all kinds of plates, saucers, cups, and silverware at my
place. Which should I use for which food? Should I sit down first or
wait for the host to invite me? Should I have brought a gift? Someone
please tell me what to do!”</p>
<p>Have you ever been in or had a nightmare about this situation? Don’t
worry! This article will help <em>==steer==</em> you through <em>==the
rocks and reefs==</em> of Anglo-American table manners so that if you
are ever abroad in Canada or the United States, or at someone’s home
from one of those countries, you will feel right at home.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish what kind of occasion you will be
attending before you plan for a pleasant evening. Most Anglo-Americans
enjoy entertaining at home, but they don’t enjoy <em>==stuffy==</em> ,
formal dinners. They invite their friends over for a fun evening, not as
a test of one’s knowledge of cultural traditions. If, however, you are
invited to a formal affair, such as a so-called “sit-down” dinner, you
may want to know in advance some basic rules of “black tie”
<em>==etiquette==</em> .</p>
<p>The first thing to remember when attending a dinner at a Western home
is that you are the guest and that you are a foreigner. No one will
invite you if he does not really want you to enter his “castle;’ so you
can be sure that you are wanted. Additionally, as you do not come from
the same country or culture as your host, he or she or they will surely
be aware of this, and will be very <em>==forgiving==</em> if you
<em>==unintentionally==</em> do or say something which would otherwise
offend them .Keeping these two simple tips in mind should greatly ease
your concern about being present at a dinner in someone else’s home.</p>
<p>Before arriving at your host’s home, you may want to make sure of
three things. First, be a few minutes late, say, about five to ten
minutes if possible. Never be early, as the host may not have everything
prepared yet. Nor should you be more than 20 minutes late. Your host may
begin to worry about whether you are able to attend the dinner or not.
Next, as to whether to bring a gift, in most informal gatherings, it is
not necessary. If you like, you can bring some fruit or sweets, or,
especially if there is a hostess, some flowers. These are
<em>==thoughtful==</em> cheerful gifts sure to please. Do not bring
alcoholic beverages unless you are sure of your host’s or hostess’s
preferences in drinks. Above all, do not spend a lot of money, and never
give money. As we say in English, ” <em>==it’s the thought that
counts==</em> !’ finally, wear comfortable clothing. One can overdress
as well as appear <em>==sloppy==</em> . For a special occasion or
religious holiday, such as a retirement party or Christmas, a tie and
jacket would be suitable for the gentlemen and a dress or sweater and
skirt for the ladies.</p>
<p>For more formal affairs, you will probably be told what to wear, such
as “formal dress requested,” etc. A tie and jacket or
<em>==tuxedo==</em> for the gents and an evening gown for the ladies
would be in order here. If you are unsure what to wear, you can always
ask the host. Gifts are seldom appropriate for these affairs, unless for
a wedding reception, at which gifts are more <em>==customary==</em> than
cash.</p>
<p>Your host in his home will usually <em>==motion==</em> you where to
sit. At formal gatherings, name cards are sometimes provided, or you
will be told where to sit. Do not be alarmed by a great deal of
<em>==cutlery==</em> : simply start from the outside and work your way
in. Formal affairs often have several courses of food with the
appropriate cutlery for each dish. There is no harm in checking with
your neighbor to see what <em>==implement==</em> he is using. After all,
” <em>==When in Rome, do as the Romans do==</em> :’ It is customary to
ask others to pass dishes to you for self-serving; at a formal dinner
party, there is usually catering (service). Again, do not hesitate to
ask others for information or advice. They are usually pleased to help
you.</p>
<p>The most important piece of advice is this: enjoy yourself. No host
enjoys seeing nervous or fearful guests who are struggling to “do the
right thing” at his home or expensive formal dinner party. Watch others
or ask for their advice, and join in the conversation and good times as
best you can .If you do, after the first such evening out, you will
certainly look forward to the next!</p>
<p>“哦，不！我现在身处一个美国家庭的餐桌旁。我面前摆放着各种各样的盘子、茶碟、杯子和银餐具。吃不同的食物该用哪件餐具呢？我应该先坐下还是等主人邀请呢？我该带个礼物来吗？谁能告诉我该怎么做啊！”</p>
<p>你是否曾经历过这种情况或者做过关于它的噩梦呢？别担心！本文将帮助你避开英美餐桌礼仪的暗礁险滩，这样一来，如果你身处加拿大或美国，或者在来自这两个国家之一的某个人家里，你会感觉宾至如归。</p>
<p>在你为一个愉快的夜晚做准备之前，区分你要参加的是哪种场合很重要。大多数英美人士喜欢在家招待客人，但他们不喜欢古板、正式的晚宴。他们邀请朋友来共度欢乐时光，而不是来考验某人对文化传统的了解。然而，如果你被邀请参加一个正式活动，比如所谓的“坐下来吃”的晚宴，你可能想提前了解一些“黑领结”礼仪的基本规则。</p>
<p>当你在西方人家中参加晚宴时，首先要记住的是你是客人，而且你是个外国人。如果主人不是真心想邀请你进入他的“城堡”，就不会邀请你，所以你可以确定你是受欢迎的。此外，由于你和主人来自不同的国家或文化，他或她或他们肯定会意识到这一点，如果你无意中做了或说了某些否则会冒犯他们的事情，他们会非常宽容。记住这两个简单的要点应该会大大减轻你对在别人家参加晚宴的担忧。</p>
<p>在到达主人家之前，你可能想确认三件事。首先，稍微迟到几分钟，比如说，如果可能的话，大约迟到五到十分钟。绝不要早到，因为主人可能还没有把一切都准备好。你也不应该迟到超过二十分钟。你的主人可能会开始担心你是否能来参加晚宴。其次，关于是否带礼物，在大多数非正式聚会上，这不是必需的。如果你愿意，你可以带些水果或糖果，或者，特别是如果有女主人的话，带些花。这些都是贴心又讨喜的礼物。除非你确定主人或女主人对饮品的喜好，否则不要带酒精饮料。最重要的是，不要花很多钱，而且绝对不要给钱。就像我们在英语里说的，“心意最重要！”最后，穿舒适的衣服。一个人既可能穿得过于讲究，也可能显得邋遢。对于特殊场合或宗教节日，比如退休派对或圣诞节，男士穿领带和夹克会很合适，女士穿连衣裙或毛衣加裙子。</p>
<p>对于更正式的活动，你可能会被告知该穿什么，比如“要求着正装”等等。这里男士穿领带和夹克或无尾礼服，女士穿晚礼服。如果你不确定穿什么，你总是可以问主人。在这些活动中，礼物很少合适，除非是婚礼招待会，在婚礼上送礼物比送现金更常见。</p>
<p>在他家，主人通常会示意你坐在哪里。在正式聚会上，有时会提供名片，或者会告诉你坐在哪里。不要被大量的餐具吓到：只需从外面开始，按顺序往里用。正式活动通常有好几道菜，每道菜都配有合适的餐具。向你的邻座询问他正在使用什么餐具并无坏处。毕竟，“入乡随俗”。按习俗，人们会请别人把菜递给自己以便自取食物；在正式晚宴聚会上，通常会有餐饮服务（侍者服务）。同样，不要犹豫向别人寻求信息或建议。他们通常很乐意帮助你。</p>
<p>最重要的一条建议是：尽情享受。没有哪个主人喜欢看到紧张或害怕的客人在他家里或昂贵的正式晚宴聚会上努力“做对事情”。观察别人或者向他们请教，尽你所能加入谈话并享受美好时光。如果你这样做了，在第一次这样的外出晚宴之后，你肯定会期待下一次！</p>

<p>During an American election, a rich man can hand out $1 million
checks to prospective voters. Companies and people can use secretly
funded “dark money” nonprofits to donate unlimited money, anonymously,
to super PACs, which can then spend it on advertising campaigns.
Podcasters, partisans, or anyone, really, can tell outrageous,
incendiary lies about a candidate. They can boost those
<em>==falsehoods==</em> through targeted online advertising. No special
courts or election rules can stop the <em>==disinformation==</em> from
spreading before voters see it. The court of public opinion, which over
the past decade has seen and heard everything, no longer cares. U.S.
elections are now a political Las Vegas: Anything goes.</p>
<p>But that’s not the way elections are run in other countries. In
Britain, political parties are, at least during the run-up to an
election, limited to spending no more than £54,010 per candidate. In
Germany, as in many other European countries, the state funds political
parties, <em>==proportionate==</em> to their number of elected
<em>==parliamentarians==</em> , so that politicians do not have to
depend on, and become <em>==corrupted==</em> by, wealthy donors. In
Poland, courts <em>==fast-track==</em> election-related libel cases in
the weeks before a vote in order to discourage people from lying.</p>
<p>Nor is this unique to Europe. Many democracies have state or public
media that are obligated, at least in principle, to give equal time to
all sides. Many require political donations to be transparent, with the
names of donors listed in an online registry. Many have limits on
political advertising. Some countries also have rules about hate speech
and indict people who break them.</p>
<p>Countries apply these laws to create conditions for fair debate, to
build trust in the system, and to inspire confidence in the winning
candidates. Some democracies believe that transparency matters—that
voters should know who is funding their candidates, as well as who is
paying for political messages on social media or anywhere else. In some
places, these rules have <em>==a loftier goal==</em> : to prevent the
rise of anti democratic <em>==extremism==</em> of the kind that has
<em>==engulfed==</em> democracies— and especially European democracies—
in the past.</p>
<p>But for how much longer can democracies pursue these goals? We live
in a world in which <em>==algorithms==</em> controlled by American and
Chinese <em>==oligarchs==</em> choose the messages and images seen by
millions of people; in which money can move through secret bank accounts
with the help of <em>==crypto==</em> schemes; and in which this dark
money can then boost anonymous social-media accounts with the aim of
shaping public opinion. In such a world, how can any election rules be
enforced? If you are <em>==Albania==</em> , or even the United Kingdom,
do you still get to set the parameters of your public debate? Or are you
now forced to be Las Vegas too?</p>
<p><strong>ALTHOUGH IT’S EASY</strong> to get distracted by the
schoolyard nicknames and <em>==irresponsible==</em>
<em>==pedophilia==</em> accusations that Elon Musk <em>==flings==</em>
around, these are the real questions posed by his open, aggressive use
of X to spread false information and promote extremist and anti-European
politicians in the U.K., Germany, and elsewhere. The integrity of
elections— and the possibility of debate <em>==untainted==</em> by
misinformation injected from abroad—is equally challenged by TikTok, the
Chinese platform, and by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, whose
<em>==subsidiaries==</em> include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and
threads. TikTok says the company does not accept any paid political
advertising. Meta, which announced in January that it is abandoning
<em>==fact-checking==</em> on its sites in the U.S., also says it will
continue to comply with European laws. But even before Zucker berg’s
radical policy change, these promises were empty. Meta’s
<em>==vaunted==</em> content <em>==curation==</em> and moderation have
never been transparent. Nobody knew, and nobody knows, what exactly
Facebook’s algorithm was promoting and why. Even an occasional user of
these platforms encounters <em>==spammers==</em> , <em>==scammers==</em>
, and <em>==opaque==</em> accounts running foreign influence operations.
No guide to the algorithm, and no real choices about it, are available
on Meta products, X, or TikTok.</p>
<p>In truth, no one knows if any platforms really comply with
political-funding rules either, because nobody outside the companies can
fully monitor what happens online during an intense election
campaign—and after the voting has ended, it’s too late. According to
<em>==declassified==</em> Romanian-intelligence documents, someone
allegedly spent more than $1 million on TikTok content in the 18 months
before an election in support of a Romanian presidential candidate who
declared that he himself had spent nothing at all. In a belated attempt
to address this and other alleged discrepancies, a Romanian court
canceled the first round of that election, a decision that itself
damaged Romanian democracy.</p>
<p>Not all of this is new. <em>==Surreptitious==</em> political-party
funding was a feature of the Cold War, and the Russian government has
continued this practice, sometimes by offering deals to foreign
businesspeople close to pro-Russian politicians. Press moguls with
international political ambitions are hardly a <em>==novelty==</em> .
Rupert Murdoch, an Australian who has U.S. <em>==citizenship==</em> ,
has long played an outsize role in U.K. politics through his media
companies. John Major, the former British prime minister and
Conservative Party leader, has said that in 1997, Murdoch threatened to
pull his newspapers’ support unless the prime minister pursued a more
anti-European policy. Major refused. Murdoch has said, “I have never
asked a prime minister for anything,” but one of his Conservativeleaning
<em>==tabloids==</em> , <em>the Sun</em>, did endorse the Labour Party
in the next election. Major lost.</p>
<p>That incident now seems almost <em>==quaint==</em> . Even at the
height of its influence, the print edition of <em>the Sun</em> sold 4
million copies a day. More to the point, it operated, and still does,
within the <em>==constraints==</em> of U.K. rules and regulations, as do
all broadcast and print media. Murdoch’s newspapers take British
<em>==libel==</em> and <em>==hatespeech==</em> laws into consideration
when they run stories. His business strategy is necessarily shaped by
rules limiting what a single company can own. After his journalists were
accused of hacking phones and bribing police in the early 2000s, Murdoch
himself had to testify before an investigative commission, and he closed
down one of his tabloids for good.</p>
<p>Social media not only has far greater reach—Musk’s personal X account
has more than 212 million followers, giving him enormous power to set
the news agenda around the world— <em>==it also exists outside the legal
system==</em> . Under the American law known as Section 230, passed
nearly three decades ago, internet platforms are not treated as
publishers in the U.S. In practice, neither Facebook nor X has the same
legal responsibility for what appears on their platforms as do, say,
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and CNN. And this, too, has
consequences: Americans have created the information climate that other
countries must accept, and this allows <em>==deceptive==</em> election
practices to thrive. If countries don’t have their own laws, and until
recently most did not, Section 230 <em>==effectively==</em> requires
them to treat social-media companies as if they exist outside their
legal systems too.</p>
<p>Brazil broke with this pattern last year, when a judge demanded that
Musk comply with Brazilian laws against spreading misinformation and
political extremism, and forced X offline until he did. Several European
countries, including the U.K., Germany, and France, have also passed
laws designed to bring the platforms into compliance with their own
legal systems, mandating fines for companies that violate hatespeech
laws or host other illegal content. But these laws are controversial and
hard to enforce. Besides, “illegal speech” is not necessarily the
central problem. No laws prevented Musk from interviewing Alice Weidel,
a leader of the <em>==far-right==</em> Alternative for Germany (AfD)
party, on X, thereby providing her with a huge platform, available to no
other political candidate, in the month before a national election. the
interview, which included several <em>==glaringly==</em> false
statements (among others, that Weidel was the “leading” candidate), was
viewed 45 million times in 24 hours, a number far beyond the reach of
any German public or private media.</p>
<p><strong>ONLY ON INSTITUTION</strong> on the planet is large enough
and powerful enough to write and enforce laws that could make the tech
companies change their policies. Partly for that reason, the European
Union may soon become one of the Trump administration’s most
<em>==prominent==</em> targets. In theory, the EU’s Digital Services
Act, which <em>==took full effect==</em> last year, can be used to
regulate, fine, and, in extreme circumstances, ban internet companies
whose practices <em>==clash with==</em> European laws. Yet a primary
<em>==intent==</em> of the act is not <em>==punitive==</em> , but rather
to open up the platforms: to allow <em>==vetted==</em> researchers
access to platform data, and to give citizens more transparency about
what they hear and see. Freedom of speech also means the right to
receive information, and at the moment social-media companies operate
behind a curtain. We don’t know if they are promoting or suppressing
certain points of view, <em>==curbing==</em> or encouraging
<em>==orchestrated==</em> political campaigns, discouraging or provoking
violent riots. Above all, we don’t know who is paying for misinformation
to be spread online.</p>
<p>In the past, the EU has not hesitated to try to apply European law to
tech companies. Over the past decade, for example, Google has faced
three fines totaling more than $8 billion for breaking antitrust law
(though one of these fines was <em>==overturned==</em> by the EU’s
General Court in 2024).</p>
<p>In November, the European Commission ned Meta more than $800 million
for unfair trade practices. But for how much longer will the EU have
this authority? In the fall, J. D. Vance issued an extraordinarily
<em>==unsubtle==</em> threat, one that is frequently repeated in Europe.
“If NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to
continue to be a good participant in this military alliance,” Vance told
an interviewer, “why don’t you respect American values and respect free
speech?” Mark Zuckerberg, echoing Vance’s <em>==misuse==</em> of the
expression free speech to mean “freedom to conceal company practices
from the public,” put it even more <em>==crudely==</em> . In a
conversation with Joe Rogan in January, Zuckerberg said he feels
“optimistic” that President Donald Trump will intervene to stop the EU
from enforcing its own <em>==antitrust==</em> laws: “I think he just
wants America to win.”</p>
<p>Does America “winning” mean that European democracies, and maybe
other democracies, lose? Some European politicians think it might.
Robert Habeck, the German vice <em>==chancellor==</em> and a leader of
that country’s Green Party,</p>
<p>believes that Musk’s <em>==frenzies==</em> of political activity on X
aren’t the random <em>==blurts==</em> of an <em>==addled==</em> mind,
but rather are “logical and systematic.” In his New Year’s address,
Habeck said that Musk is deliberately “strengthening those who are
weakening Europe,” including the explicitly anti-European AfD. This, he
believes, is because “a weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom
regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power.”</p>
<p>Until recently, Russia was the most important state seeking to
<em>==undermine==</em> European institutions. Vladimir Putin has long
disliked the EU because it restricts Russian companies’ ability to
intimidate and <em>==bribe==</em> European political leaders and
companies, and because the EU is larger and more powerful than Russia,
whereas European countries on their own are not. Now a group of American
oligarchs also want to undermine European institutions, because they
don’t want to be regulated—and they may have the American president on
their side. Quite soon, the European Union, along with Great Britain and
other democracies around the world, might find that they have to choose
between their <em>==alliance==</em> with the United States and their
ability to run their own elections and select their own leaders without
the pressure of aggressive outside manipulation. <em>==Ironically==</em>
, countries, such as Brazil, that don’t have the same deep military,
economic, and cultural ties to the U.S. may and it easier to maintain
the <em>==sovereignty==</em> of their political systems and the
transparency of their information ecosystems than Europeans.</p>
<p>A <em>==crunch==</em> point is <em>==imminent==</em> , when the
European Commission finally concludes a year-long investigation into X.
<em>==Tellingly==</em> , two people who have advised the commission on
this investigation would talk with me only off the record, because the
potential for <em>==reprisals==</em> against them and their
organizations— whether it be online <em>==trolling==</em> and harassment
or lawsuits— is too great. Still, both advisers said that the commission
has the power to protect Europe’s sovereignty, and to force the
platforms to be more transparent. “¦e commission should look at the
<em>==raft==</em> of laws and rules it has available and see how they
can be applied,” one of them told me, “always remembering that this is
not about taking action against a person’s voice. ¦is is the commission
saying that everyone’s voice should be equal.”</p>
<p>At least in theory, no country is obligated to become <em>==an
electoral Las Vegas==</em> , as America has. Global democracies could
demand greater transparency around the use of algorithms, both on social
media and in the online-advertising market more broadly. ¦ey could other
consumers more control over what they see, and more information about
what they don’t see. ¦ey could enforce their own campaign-funding laws.
These changes could make the internet more open and fair, and therefore
a better, safer place for the exercise of free speech. If the chances of
success seem narrow, it’s not because of the lack of a viable legal
framework— rather it’s because, at the moment, <em>==cowardice==</em> is
as <em>==viral==</em> as one of Musk’s <em>==tweets==</em> .</p>
