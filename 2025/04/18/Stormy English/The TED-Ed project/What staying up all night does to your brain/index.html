staying up\r\nall night does to your brain\r\nYou’re just one Roman Empire history final away from a relaxing\r\nspring break.\r\nBut you still have so much to study!\r\nSo you decide to follow in the footsteps of many students before you\r\nand pull an all-nighter.\r\nWhen you stay up all night, you’re fighting against your body’s\r\nnatural circadian rhythms.\r\nThese are the cyclical changes that virtually all living things\r\nexperience over the course of a 24-hour period—such as sleeping and\r\nwaking—and they’re heavily influenced by light.\r\nBut for the moment, you’re alert and powering through the rule of\r\nJulius Caesar.\r\nAs the sun sets, your eyes send signals about the dwindling light to\r\na part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.\r\nThis is basically your circadian rhythm’s clock.\r\nIt alerts your pineal gland to start producing melatonin.\r\nThat’s the hormone that helps prepare your body for sleep, and levels\r\nstart to rise about two hours before your normal bedtime.\r\nAt the same time, neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem release\r\na compound called GABA.\r\nThis slows down activity in your brain and can have a calming\r\neffect.\r\nYou’re approaching your normal bedtime.\r\nSince the brain needs to cool down before sleep, your core body\r\ntemperature starts to drop.\r\nHuh, that map kind of looks like a face.\r\nUh-oh, your attention has started to drift.\r\nThroughout the day, your brain has been releasing a waste product\r\ncalled adenosine.\r\nThe more adenosine latching onto receptors in your brain, the more\r\ntired and inattentive you become.\r\nTime for a cup of coffee.\r\nCaffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors, which can give\r\nyou a boost of energy.\r\nHowever, it might also make you jittery and increase your\r\nanxiety.\r\nYou’re acing these flashcards!\r\nRight now these dates and names are being stored in an area of the\r\nbrain called the hippocampus.\r\nNormally when you go to sleep, memories like these are consolidated\r\nand slotted into long-term storage in your brain’s neocortex.\r\nSo it’s a good thing you only need to remember this information\r\nthrough tomorrow.\r\nMicrosleeps are unpredictable periods of sleep that last for only a\r\nfew seconds and are triggered by sleep deprivation.\r\nYou stretch in an attempt to stay awake.\r\nBut at this point your motor skills have also taken a hit.\r\nStudies have found that people who have been awake for 19 hours have\r\nsimilar coordination and reaction times as those who have been\r\ndrinking.\r\nAs the sun rises, your pineal gland stops releasing melatonin.\r\nYou feel a “second wind” come on.\r\nAnd despite everything, you leave for school in a really good\r\nmood.\r\nSleep deprivation can briefly induce euphoria.\r\nIt’s caused by a temporary boost in dopamine levels, which can\r\nunfortunately also lead to poor choices.\r\nThe final starts off well.\r\nIt’s all multiple choice!\r\nBut then you get to the essay portion.\r\nIt’s thought that during sleep, our brains process ideas and draw\r\nconnections between new memories and old ones.\r\nSo your sleepless brain might be able to regurgitate facts, but\r\nyou’re finding it more difficult to find patterns or problem solve.\r\nYou stare at the blank page, defeated.\r\nYou head up to your room, anxious and irritable.\r\nYour amygdala, the part of the brain involved with processing\r\nemotion, is going haywire.\r\nYour prefrontal cortex usually keeps your amygdala in check, but it\r\nstill isn’t firing on all cylinders.\r\nYour bed has never felt so sweet.\r\nAfter one sleepless night, your body and brain bounce back pretty\r\nquickly.\r\nWhich is a good thing since we can’t always control how much sleep we\r\nget.\r\nBut going for long periods without a good night’s sleep or constantly\r\nchanging your bedtime can take its toll.\r\nRegularly getting less than seven hours of sleep each night is linked\r\nto all sorts of health issues, from diabetes to stroke to chronic\r\npain.\r\nIt also leaves you more vulnerable to developing mental health issues\r\nlike depression.\r\nYour sleep schedule can even affect your grades.\r\nStudies have shown that college students who keep regular sleep hours\r\nhave, on average, a higher GPA than students who don’t.\r\nSo the next time you’re thinking of pulling an all-nighter, remember\r\nthat Rome wasn’t built in a day, or for that matter, one night.\r\n","dateCreated":"2025-04-18T20:25:31+08:00","dateModified":"2025-08-31T10:48:02+08:00","datePublished":"2025-04-18T20:25:31+08:00","description":"","headline":"What staying up all nights

            <h1 id="what-staying-up-all-night-does-to-your-brain">What staying up
all night does to your brain</h1>
<p>You’re just one Roman Empire history final away from a relaxing
spring break.</p>
<p>But you still have so much to study!</p>
<p>So you decide to follow in the footsteps of many students before you
and pull an all-nighter.</p>
<p>When you stay up all night, you’re fighting against your body’s
natural circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>These are the cyclical changes that virtually all living things
experience over the course of a 24-hour period—such as sleeping and
waking—and they’re heavily influenced by light.</p>
<p>But for the moment, you’re alert and powering through the rule of
Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>As the sun sets, your eyes send signals about the dwindling light to
a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>This is basically your circadian rhythm’s clock.</p>
<p>It alerts your pineal gland to start producing melatonin.</p>
<p>That’s the hormone that helps prepare your body for sleep, and levels
start to rise about two hours before your normal bedtime.</p>
<p>At the same time, neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem release
a compound called GABA.</p>
<p>This slows down activity in your brain and can have a calming
effect.</p>
<p>You’re approaching your normal bedtime.</p>
<p>Since the brain needs to cool down before sleep, your core body
temperature starts to drop.</p>
<p>Huh, that map kind of looks like a face.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, your attention has started to drift.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, your brain has been releasing a waste product
called adenosine.</p>
<p>The more adenosine latching onto receptors in your brain, the more
tired and inattentive you become.</p>
<p>Time for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors, which can give
you a boost of energy.</p>
<p>However, it might also make you jittery and increase your
anxiety.</p>
<p>You’re acing these flashcards!</p>
<p>Right now these dates and names are being stored in an area of the
brain called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Normally when you go to sleep, memories like these are consolidated
and slotted into long-term storage in your brain’s neocortex.</p>
<p>So it’s a good thing you only need to remember this information
through tomorrow.</p>
<p>Microsleeps are unpredictable periods of sleep that last for only a
few seconds and are triggered by sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>You stretch in an attempt to stay awake.</p>
<p>But at this point your motor skills have also taken a hit.</p>
<p>Studies have found that people who have been awake for 19 hours have
similar coordination and reaction times as those who have been
drinking.</p>
<p>As the sun rises, your pineal gland stops releasing melatonin.</p>
<p>You feel a “second wind” come on.</p>
<p>And despite everything, you leave for school in a really good
mood.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation can briefly induce euphoria.</p>
<p>It’s caused by a temporary boost in dopamine levels, which can
unfortunately also lead to poor choices.</p>
<p>The final starts off well.</p>
<p>It’s all multiple choice!</p>
<p>But then you get to the essay portion.</p>
<p>It’s thought that during sleep, our brains process ideas and draw
connections between new memories and old ones.</p>
<p>So your sleepless brain might be able to regurgitate facts, but
you’re finding it more difficult to find patterns or problem solve.</p>
<p>You stare at the blank page, defeated.</p>
<p>You head up to your room, anxious and irritable.</p>
<p>Your amygdala, the part of the brain involved with processing
emotion, is going haywire.</p>
<p>Your prefrontal cortex usually keeps your amygdala in check, but it
still isn’t firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>Your bed has never felt so sweet.</p>
<p>After one sleepless night, your body and brain bounce back pretty
quickly.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing since we can’t always control how much sleep we
get.</p>
<p>But going for long periods without a good night’s sleep or constantly
changing your bedtime can take its toll.</p>
<p>Regularly getting less than seven hours of sleep each night is linked
to all sorts of health issues, from diabetes to stroke to chronic
pain.</p>
<p>It also leaves you more vulnerable to developing mental health issues
like depression.</p>
<p>Your sleep schedule can even affect your grades.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that college students who keep regular sleep hours
have, on average, a higher GPA than students who don’t.</p>
<p>So the next time you’re thinking of pulling an all-nighter, remember
that Rome wasn’t built in a day, or for that matter, one night.</p>
