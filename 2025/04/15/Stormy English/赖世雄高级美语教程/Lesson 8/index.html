What is less well known is that English\r\nis also the mother ==tongue== in countries such as the Republic\r\nof Ireland (officially called Eire), Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, and\r\nGuyana. Among these latter few, the Irish have made contributions to the\r\nEnglish language in both its ==lexicon== and literature which\r\ncan ==be considered second to none== .\r\n==Virtually== every aspect of English literature has been\r\ngraced by the writings of the Irish. This fact is all the more amazing\r\nbecause Ireland is a relatively small country, with never more than four\r\nmillion people throughout its long history. Yet many great “English”\r\nwriters were indeed born and often raised in Ireland, though many, too,\r\nimmigrated to the United Kingdom at some point in their lives. Among\r\nthese pillars of English literature were Jonathan Swift, William Butler\r\nYeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw,\r\nand Edmund Burke. Many other lesser-known figures have\r\n==punctuated== English literature as well. These men’s\r\ncontributions to the English language and to Western thought in general\r\nare ==immeasurable== . A review of two of these writers’ major\r\nworks will reveal why.\r\nJonathan Swift (1667 -1745) by most reckoning is the best\r\nEnglish-language satirist ever, and one of the world’s greatest as well.\r\nBorn in Ireland of English parents, Swift went to school there through\r\nhis bachelor’s degree (Trinity College, Dublin, capital of Ireland).\r\nThereafter he frequently Traveled between England and Ireland, including\r\nyears spent at Oxford College, where he earned his master’s degree.\r\nSwift wrote a great deal of poetry, but he is best regarded as a\r\n==prose== ==satirist== . He wrote\r\n==prolifically== both in Ireland and England, nearly constantly\r\nshuttling from one to the other. In Ireland he worked on Gulliver’s\r\nTravels, which he later had published in England in 1726. Already famous\r\nby that time, Swift would become ==immortalized== with this\r\nlast great work. What child does not know the story of the brave sailor\r\nGulliver as he travels through lands in which he is at turn both a giant\r\nand a ==midget== ? Yet most readers are not aware of Swift’s\r\nintent to satirize the political, academic, and religious leaders of his\r\ntime. Read either way, Swift’s genius as a writer of English cannot be\r\ndenied.\r\nA giant of English Theater was George Bernard Shaw(1856 - 1950) .\r\nBorn in Dublin, Shaw moved to England with his family when he was 20 and\r\nstayed there for most of the rest of his long life. His early fiction\r\nwriting was so poor that he could not find a publisher. Only when he\r\nbegan to work as a ==playwright== did his ==fortunes==\r\nimprove. Among the many, many plays for which Shaw is famous, perhaps\r\nhis most lasting (though not his most critically acclaimed) is Pygmalion\r\n(1916), the story of a language teacher who attempts to” civilize” a\r\nyoung ==prostitute== by training her to speak correctly. If\r\nthis story sounds familiar, it should: ==Pygmalion== was later\r\nfilmed winning on Oscar for Shaw and later again transformed into the\r\nhighly popular Broadway musical My Fair Lady (1956). A good story never\r\ndies: the original Pygmalion has since been updated in the hit movie\r\nPretty woman (1990) starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. As with\r\nShakespeare, many of Shaw’s plays are continually restaged or rewritten\r\ninto new media because Shaw wrote on many themes which touch on the\r\nhuman condition, ==independent of time and space== .\r\nAmong the ==constellation== of Irish talents, perhaps Swift\r\nand Shaw are two among the more brilliant stars, but much more could be\r\nwritten of those mentioned above and many others. Though English\r\nliterature written by the British suffices as an eternal and shining\r\n==canon== of literature, it would be nonetheless\r\n==dimmer== without the considerable talents of its Irish\r\ncontributors\r\nVocabulary &amp; Idioms\r\n\r\ntongue——语言\r\nlexicon——全部词汇\r\nbe second to none——无人出其右\r\nvirtually——几乎\r\npunctuate——不时打断\r\nimmeasurable——不可估量的\r\nprose——散文\r\nimmortalize——永垂不朽\r\nmidget——侏儒\r\nplaywright——剧作家\r\nfortune——前途\r\nprostitute——妓女\r\nPygmalion——《茶花女》\r\nindependent of time and space——独立于时间和空间\r\nconstellation——星座\r\ncanon——精品\r\ndimmer——暗淡的\r\n\r\n","dateCreated":"2025-04-15T11:23:03+08:00","dateModified":"2025-08-31T10:48:02+08:00","datePublished":"2025-04-15T11:23:03+08:00","description":"","headline":"Lesson8 Ireland's Contribution to English","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://hydrogen1222.xyz/2025/04/15/Stormy%20English/%E8%B5%96%E4%B8%96%E9%9B%84%E9%AB%98%E7%BA%A7%E7%BE%8E%E8%AF%AD%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Lesson%208/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"John Doe","sameAs":["https://github.com/hydrogen1222","https://user.qzone.qq.com/2170147489/infocenter","https://space.bilibili.com/441987358?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0","mailto:tanch1222@mails.jlu.edu.cn"]},"url":"https://hydrogen1222.xyz/2025/04/15/Stormy%20English/%E8%B5%96%E4%B8%96%E9%9B%84%E9%AB%98%E7%BA%A7%E7%BE%8E%E8%AF%AD%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Lesson%208/","keywords":"English, Learning"}</script>

English</h2>
<p>Nearly everyone knows that countries such as the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are
primarily English-speaking countries; that is, English is the mother
tongue used in these countries. What is less well known is that English
is also the mother <em>==tongue==</em> in countries such as the Republic
of Ireland (officially called Eire), Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, and
Guyana. Among these latter few, the Irish have made contributions to the
English language in both its <em>==lexicon==</em> and literature which
can <em>==be considered second to none==</em> .</p>
<p><em>==Virtually==</em> every aspect of English literature has been
graced by the writings of the Irish. This fact is all the more amazing
because Ireland is a relatively small country, with never more than four
million people throughout its long history. Yet many great “English”
writers were indeed born and often raised in Ireland, though many, too,
immigrated to the United Kingdom at some point in their lives. Among
these pillars of English literature were Jonathan Swift, William Butler
Yeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw,
and Edmund Burke. Many other lesser-known figures have
<em>==punctuated==</em> English literature as well. These men’s
contributions to the English language and to Western thought in general
are <em>==immeasurable==</em> . A review of two of these writers’ major
works will reveal why.</p>
<p>Jonathan Swift (1667 -1745) by most reckoning is the best
English-language satirist ever, and one of the world’s greatest as well.
Born in Ireland of English parents, Swift went to school there through
his bachelor’s degree (Trinity College, Dublin, capital of Ireland).
Thereafter he frequently Traveled between England and Ireland, including
years spent at Oxford College, where he earned his master’s degree.
Swift wrote a great deal of poetry, but he is best regarded as a
<em>==prose==</em> <em>==satirist==</em> . He wrote
<em>==prolifically==</em> both in Ireland and England, nearly constantly
shuttling from one to the other. In Ireland he worked on Gulliver’s
Travels, which he later had published in England in 1726. Already famous
by that time, Swift would become <em>==immortalized==</em> with this
last great work. What child does not know the story of the brave sailor
Gulliver as he travels through lands in which he is at turn both a giant
and a <em>==midget==</em> ? Yet most readers are not aware of Swift’s
intent to satirize the political, academic, and religious leaders of his
time. Read either way, Swift’s genius as a writer of English cannot be
denied.</p>
<p>A giant of English Theater was George Bernard Shaw(1856 - 1950) .
Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to England with his family when he was 20 and
stayed there for most of the rest of his long life. His early fiction
writing was so poor that he could not find a publisher. Only when he
began to work as a <em>==playwright==</em> did his <em>==fortunes==</em>
improve. Among the many, many plays for which Shaw is famous, perhaps
his most lasting (though not his most critically acclaimed) is Pygmalion
(1916), the story of a language teacher who attempts to” civilize” a
young <em>==prostitute==</em> by training her to speak correctly. If
this story sounds familiar, it should: <em>==Pygmalion==</em> was later
filmed winning on Oscar for Shaw and later again transformed into the
highly popular Broadway musical My Fair Lady (1956). A good story never
dies: the original Pygmalion has since been updated in the hit movie
Pretty woman (1990) starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. As with
Shakespeare, many of Shaw’s plays are continually restaged or rewritten
into new media because Shaw wrote on many themes which touch on the
human condition, <em>==independent of time and space==</em> .</p>
<p>Among the <em>==constellation==</em> of Irish talents, perhaps Swift
and Shaw are two among the more brilliant stars, but much more could be
written of those mentioned above and many others. Though English
literature written by the British suffices as an eternal and shining
<em>==canon==</em> of literature, it would be nonetheless
<em>==dimmer==</em> without the considerable talents of its Irish
contributors</p>
