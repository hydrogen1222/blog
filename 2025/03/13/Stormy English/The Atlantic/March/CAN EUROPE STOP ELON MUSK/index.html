Companies and people can use secretly\r\nfunded “dark money” nonprofits to donate unlimited money, anonymously,\r\nto super PACs, which can then spend it on advertising campaigns.\r\nPodcasters, partisans, or anyone, really, can tell outrageous,\r\nincendiary lies about a candidate. They can boost those\r\n==falsehoods== through targeted online advertising. No special\r\ncourts or election rules can stop the ==disinformation== from\r\nspreading before voters see it. The court of public opinion, which over\r\nthe past decade has seen and heard everything, no longer cares. U.S.\r\nelections are now a political Las Vegas: Anything goes.\r\nBut that’s not the way elections are run in other countries. In\r\nBritain, political parties are, at least during the run-up to an\r\nelection, limited to spending no more than £54,010 per candidate. In\r\nGermany, as in many other European countries, the state funds political\r\nparties, ==proportionate== to their number of elected\r\n==parliamentarians== , so that politicians do not have to\r\ndepend on, and become ==corrupted== by, wealthy donors. In\r\nPoland, courts ==fast-track== election-related libel cases in\r\nthe weeks before a vote in order to discourage people from lying.\r\nNor is this unique to Europe. Many democracies have state or public\r\nmedia that are obligated, at least in principle, to give equal time to\r\nall sides. Many require political donations to be transparent, with the\r\nnames of donors listed in an online registry. Many have limits on\r\npolitical advertising. Some countries also have rules about hate speech\r\nand indict people who break them.\r\nCountries apply these laws to create conditions for fair debate, to\r\nbuild trust in the system, and to inspire confidence in the winning\r\ncandidates. Some democracies believe that transparency matters—that\r\nvoters should know who is funding their candidates, as well as who is\r\npaying for political messages on social media or anywhere else. In some\r\nplaces, these rules have ==a loftier goal== : to prevent the\r\nrise of anti democratic ==extremism== of the kind that has\r\n==engulfed== democracies— and especially European democracies—\r\nin the past.\r\nBut for how much longer can democracies pursue these goals? We live\r\nin a world in which ==algorithms== controlled by American and\r\nChinese ==oligarchs== choose the messages and images seen by\r\nmillions of people; in which money can move through secret bank accounts\r\nwith the help of ==crypto== schemes; and in which this dark\r\nmoney can then boost anonymous social-media accounts with the aim of\r\nshaping public opinion. In such a world, how can any election rules be\r\nenforced? If you are ==Albania== , or even the United Kingdom,\r\ndo you still get to set the parameters of your public debate? Or are you\r\nnow forced to be Las Vegas too?\r\nALTHOUGH IT’S EASY to get distracted by the\r\nschoolyard nicknames and ==irresponsible==\r\n==pedophilia== accusations that Elon Musk ==flings==\r\naround, these are the real questions posed by his open, aggressive use\r\nof X to spread false information and promote extremist and anti-European\r\npoliticians in the U.K., Germany, and elsewhere. The integrity of\r\nelections— and the possibility of debate ==untainted== by\r\nmisinformation injected from abroad—is equally challenged by TikTok, the\r\nChinese platform, and by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, whose\r\n==subsidiaries== include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and\r\nthreads. TikTok says the company does not accept any paid political\r\nadvertising. Meta, which announced in January that it is abandoning\r\n==fact-checking== on its sites in the U.S., also says it will\r\ncontinue to comply with European laws. But even before Zucker berg’s\r\nradical policy change, these promises were empty. Meta’s\r\n==vaunted== content ==curation== and moderation have\r\nnever been transparent. Nobody knew, and nobody knows, what exactly\r\nFacebook’s algorithm was promoting and why. Even an occasional user of\r\nthese platforms encounters ==spammers== , ==scammers==\r\n, and ==opaque== accounts running foreign influence operations.\r\nNo guide to the algorithm, and no real choices about it, are available\r\non Meta products, X, or TikTok.\r\nIn truth, no one knows if any platforms really comply with\r\npolitical-funding rules either, because nobody outside the companies can\r\nfully monitor what happens online during an intense election\r\ncampaign—and after the voting has ended, it’s too late. According to\r\n==declassified== Romanian-intelligence documents, someone\r\nallegedly spent more than $1 million on TikTok content in the 18 months\r\nbefore an election in support of a Romanian presidential candidate who\r\ndeclared that he himself had spent nothing at all. In a belated attempt\r\nto address this and other alleged discrepancies, a Romanian court\r\ncanceled the first round of that election, a decision that itself\r\ndamaged Romanian democracy.\r\nNot all of this is new. ==Surreptitious== political-party\r\nfunding was a feature of the Cold War, and the Russian government has\r\ncontinued this practice, sometimes by offering deals to foreign\r\nbusinesspeople close to pro-Russian politicians. Press moguls with\r\ninternational political ambitions are hardly a ==novelty== .\r\nRupert Murdoch, an Australian who has U.S. ==citizenship== ,\r\nhas long played an outsize role in U.K. politics through his media\r\ncompanies. John Major, the former British prime minister and\r\nConservative Party leader, has said that in 1997, Murdoch threatened to\r\npull his newspapers’ support unless the prime minister pursued a more\r\nanti-European policy. Major refused. Murdoch has said, “I have never\r\nasked a prime minister for anything,” but one of his Conservativeleaning\r\n==tabloids== , the Sun, did endorse the Labour Party\r\nin the next election. Major lost.\r\nThat incident now seems almost ==quaint== . Even at the\r\nheight of its influence, the print edition of the Sun sold 4\r\nmillion copies a day. More to the point, it operated, and still does,\r\nwithin the ==constraints== of U.K. rules and regulations, as do\r\nall broadcast and print media. Murdoch’s newspapers take British\r\n==libel== and ==hatespeech== laws into consideration\r\nwhen they run stories. His business strategy is necessarily shaped by\r\nrules limiting what a single company can own. After his journalists were\r\naccused of hacking phones and bribing police in the early 2000s, Murdoch\r\nhimself had to testify before an investigative commission, and he closed\r\ndown one of his tabloids for good.\r\nSocial media not only has far greater reach—Musk’s personal X account\r\nhas more than 212 million followers, giving him enormous power to set\r\nthe news agenda around the world— ==it also exists outside the legal\r\nsystem== . Under the American law known as Section 230, passed\r\nnearly three decades ago, internet platforms are not treated as\r\npublishers in the U.S. In practice, neither Facebook nor X has the same\r\nlegal responsibility for what appears on their platforms as do, say,\r\nThe Wall Street Journal and CNN. And this, too, has\r\nconsequences: Americans have created the information climate that other\r\ncountries must accept, and this allows ==deceptive== election\r\npractices to thrive. If countries don’t have their own laws, and until\r\nrecently most did not, Section 230 ==effectively== requires\r\nthem to treat social-media companies as if they exist outside their\r\nlegal systems too.\r\nBrazil broke with this pattern last year, when a judge demanded that\r\nMusk comply with Brazilian laws against spreading misinformation and\r\npolitical extremism, and forced X offline until he did. Several European\r\ncountries, including the U.K., Germany, and France, have also passed\r\nlaws designed to bring the platforms into compliance with their own\r\nlegal systems, mandating fines for companies that violate hatespeech\r\nlaws or host other illegal content. But these laws are controversial and\r\nhard to enforce. Besides, “illegal speech” is not necessarily the\r\ncentral problem. No laws prevented Musk from interviewing Alice Weidel,\r\na leader of the ==far-right== Alternative for Germany (AfD)\r\nparty, on X, thereby providing her with a huge platform, available to no\r\nother political candidate, in the month before a national election. the\r\ninterview, which included several ==glaringly== false\r\nstatements (among others, that Weidel was the “leading” candidate), was\r\nviewed 45 million times in 24 hours, a number far beyond the reach of\r\nany German public or private media.\r\nONLY ON INSTITUTION on the planet is large enough\r\nand powerful enough to write and enforce laws that could make the tech\r\ncompanies change their policies. Partly for that reason, the European\r\nUnion may soon become one of the Trump administration’s most\r\n==prominent== targets. In theory, the EU’s Digital Services\r\nAct, which ==took full effect== last year, can be used to\r\nregulate, fine, and, in extreme circumstances, ban internet companies\r\nwhose practices ==clash with== European laws. Yet a primary\r\n==intent== of the act is not ==punitive== , but rather\r\nto open up the platforms: to allow ==vetted== researchers\r\naccess to platform data, and to give citizens more transparency about\r\nwhat they hear and see. Freedom of speech also means the right to\r\nreceive information, and at the moment social-media companies operate\r\nbehind a curtain. We don’t know if they are promoting or suppressing\r\ncertain points of view, ==curbing== or encouraging\r\n==orchestrated== political campaigns, discouraging or provoking\r\nviolent riots. Above all, we don’t know who is paying for misinformation\r\nto be spread online.\r\nIn the past, the EU has not hesitated to try to apply European law to\r\ntech companies. Over the past decade, for example, Google has faced\r\nthree fines totaling more than $8 billion for breaking antitrust law\r\n(though one of these fines was ==overturned== by the EU’s\r\nGeneral Court in 2024).\r\nIn November, the European Commission ned Meta more than $800 million\r\nfor unfair trade practices. But for how much longer will the EU have\r\nthis authority? In the fall, J. D. Vance issued an extraordinarily\r\n==unsubtle== threat, one that is frequently repeated in Europe.\r\n“If NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to\r\ncontinue to be a good participant in this military alliance,” Vance told\r\nan interviewer, “why don’t you respect American values and respect free\r\nspeech?” Mark Zuckerberg, echoing Vance’s ==misuse== of the\r\nexpression free speech to mean “freedom to conceal company practices\r\nfrom the public,” put it even more ==crudely== . In a\r\nconversation with Joe Rogan in January, Zuckerberg said he feels\r\n“optimistic” that President Donald Trump will intervene to stop the EU\r\nfrom enforcing its own ==antitrust== laws: “I think he just\r\nwants America to win.”\r\nDoes America “winning” mean that European democracies, and maybe\r\nother democracies, lose? Some European politicians think it might.\r\nRobert Habeck, the German vice ==chancellor== and a leader of\r\nthat country’s Green Party,\r\nbelieves that Musk’s ==frenzies== of political activity on X\r\naren’t the random ==blurts== of an ==addled== mind,\r\nbut rather are “logical and systematic.” In his New Year’s address,\r\nHabeck said that Musk is deliberately “strengthening those who are\r\nweakening Europe,” including the explicitly anti-European AfD. This, he\r\nbelieves, is because “a weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom\r\nregulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power.”\r\nUntil recently, Russia was the most important state seeking to\r\n==undermine== European institutions. Vladimir Putin has long\r\ndisliked the EU because it restricts Russian companies’ ability to\r\nintimidate and ==bribe== European political leaders and\r\ncompanies, and because the EU is larger and more powerful than Russia,\r\nwhereas European countries on their own are not. Now a group of American\r\noligarchs also want to undermine European institutions, because they\r\ndon’t want to be regulated—and they may have the American president on\r\ntheir side. Quite soon, the European Union, along with Great Britain and\r\nother democracies around the world, might find that they have to choose\r\nbetween their ==alliance== with the United States and their\r\nability to run their own elections and select their own leaders without\r\nthe pressure of aggressive outside manipulation. ==Ironically==\r\n, countries, such as Brazil, that don’t have the same deep military,\r\neconomic, and cultural ties to the U.S. may and it easier to maintain\r\nthe ==sovereignty== of their political systems and the\r\ntransparency of their information ecosystems than Europeans.\r\nA ==crunch== point is ==imminent== , when the\r\nEuropean Commission finally concludes a year-long investigation into X.\r\n==Tellingly== , two people who have advised the commission on\r\nthis investigation would talk with me only off the record, because the\r\npotential for ==reprisals== against them and their\r\norganizations— whether it be online ==trolling== and harassment\r\nor lawsuits— is too great. Still, both advisers said that the commission\r\nhas the power to protect Europe’s sovereignty, and to force the\r\nplatforms to be more transparent. “¦e commission should look at the\r\n==raft== of laws and rules it has available and see how they\r\ncan be applied,” one of them told me, “always remembering that this is\r\nnot about taking action against a person’s voice. ¦is is the commission\r\nsaying that everyone’s voice should be equal.”\r\nAt least in theory, no country is obligated to become ==an\r\nelectoral Las Vegas== , as America has. Global democracies could\r\ndemand greater transparency around the use of algorithms, both on social\r\nmedia and in the online-advertising market more broadly. ¦ey could other\r\nconsumers more control over what they see, and more information about\r\nwhat they don’t see. ¦ey could enforce their own campaign-funding laws.\r\nThese changes could make the internet more open and fair, and therefore\r\na better, safer place for the exercise of free speech. If the chances of\r\nsuccess seem narrow, it’s not because of the lack of a viable legal\r\nframework— rather it’s because, at the moment, ==cowardice== is\r\nas ==viral== as one of Musk’s ==tweets== .\r\nVocabulary, Phrases and\r\nSentences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWord\r\nChinese Definition\r\nPhonetic Symbol\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincendiary\r\n煽动性的\r\n/ɪnˈsendieri/\r\n\r\n\r\nfalsehood\r\n谎言\r\n/ˈfɔːlshʊd/\r\n\r\n\r\ndisinformation\r\n虚假信息\r\n/ˌdɪsɪnfəˈmeɪʃn/\r\n\r\n\r\nrun-up\r\n前期；准备阶段\r\n/ˈrʌn ʌp/\r\n\r\n\r\ncorrupt\r\n腐败的\r\n/kəˈrʌpt/\r\n\r\n\r\nfast-track\r\n快速推进\r\n/ˈfæst træk/\r\n\r\n\r\nbe obligated\r\n有义务\r\n/ˈbiː ˈɒblɪɡeɪtɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\nindict\r\n指控\r\n/ɪnˈdaɪt/\r\n\r\n\r\na loftier goal\r\n更高的目标\r\n/ə ˈlɔːftiə ˈɡəʊl/\r\n\r\n\r\nextremism\r\n极端主义\r\n/ɪkˈstriːmɪzəm/\r\n\r\n\r\nengulfed\r\n吞没\r\n/ɪnˈɡʌlvd/\r\n\r\n\r\nalgorithms\r\n算法\r\n/ˈælɡərɪðəmz/\r\n\r\n\r\noligarch\r\n寡头\r\n/ˈɒlɪɡɑːk/\r\n\r\n\r\ncrypto\r\n加密的\r\n/ˈkrɪptəʊ/\r\n\r\n\r\nirresponsible\r\n不负责任的\r\n/ˌɪrɪˈspɒnsəbl/\r\n\r\n\r\nfling\r\n扔；抛\r\n/ˈflɪŋ/\r\n\r\n\r\nuntainted\r\n无污点的\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries\r\n子公司\r\n/ˈsʌbsɪdɪriːz/\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is abandoning fact-checking on its sites in the U.S.\r\n它正在放弃对美国网站的事实核查\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvaunted\r\n吹嘘的\r\n/ˈvɔːntɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\nmoderation\r\n适度；节制\r\n/ˌmɒdəˈreɪʃn/\r\n\r\n\r\ncuration\r\n策划；挑选\r\n/ˌkjʊəˈreɪʃn/\r\n\r\n\r\nspammer\r\n垃圾邮件发送者\r\n/ˈspæmə(r)/\r\n\r\n\r\nscammer\r\n骗子\r\n/ˈskæmə(r)/\r\n\r\n\r\nopaque\r\n不透明的\r\n/əʊˈpeɪk/\r\n\r\n\r\ndeclassified\r\n解密的\r\n/ˌdiːˈklæsɪfaɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\nallegedly\r\n据称\r\n/əˈledʒɪdli/\r\n\r\n\r\nbelated\r\n迟来的\r\n/bɪˈleɪtɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies\r\n差异\r\n/ˌdɪskrepənsiːz/\r\n\r\n\r\nsurreptitious\r\n偷偷摸摸\r\n/ˌsʌrəpˈtɪʃəs/\r\n\r\n\r\nnovelty\r\n新奇\r\n/ˈnɒvlti/\r\n\r\n\r\ntabloid\r\n小报\r\n/ˈtæblɔɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\nendorse\r\n支持；认可\r\n/ɪnˈdɔːs/\r\n\r\n\r\nquaint\r\n古雅的\r\n/ˈkweɪnt/\r\n\r\n\r\nconstraint\r\n限制\r\n/kənˈstreɪnt/\r\n\r\n\r\nlibel\r\n诽谤\r\n/ˈlaɪbl/\r\n\r\n\r\nhate-speech\r\n仇恨言论\r\n/ˈheɪt spiːtʃ/\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also exists outside the legal system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeceptive\r\n欺骗性的\r\n/dɪˈseptɪv/\r\n\r\n\r\neffectively\r\n事实上\r\n/ɪˈfektɪvli/\r\n\r\n\r\nfar-right\r\n极右翼\r\n/ˈfɑː raɪt/\r\n\r\n\r\nglaringly\r\n明显地\r\n/ˈɡleərɪŋli/\r\n\r\n\r\nprominent\r\n突出的\r\n/ˈprɒmɪnənt/\r\n\r\n\r\ntake full effect\r\n完全生效\r\n/ˈteɪk fʊl ˈɪfekt/\r\n\r\n\r\nclash with\r\n与……冲突\r\n/ˈklæʃ wɪð/\r\n\r\n\r\nintent\r\n意图\r\n/ˈɪntent/\r\n\r\n\r\npunitive\r\n惩罚性的\r\n/ˈpjuːnətɪv/\r\n\r\n\r\nvetted\r\n审查\r\n/ˈvetɪd/\r\n\r\n\r\ncurbing\r\n控制\r\n/ˈkɜːbɪŋ/\r\n\r\n\r\norchestrated political campaigns\r\n精心策划的政治运动\r\n/ˈɔːkɪstreɪtɪd pəˈlɪtɪkl kæmˈpeɪnz/\r\n\r\n\r\nriot\r\n暴乱\r\n/ˈraɪət/\r\n\r\n\r\noverturn\r\n推翻\r\n/ˈəʊvətɜːn/\r\n\r\n\r\nunsubtle\r\n不微妙的\r\n/ˈʌnˈsʌtl/\r\n\r\n\r\nmisuse\r\n滥用\r\n/ˈmɪsjuːz/\r\n\r\n\r\ncrudely\r\n粗糙地\r\n/ˈkruːdli/\r\n\r\n\r\nantitrust\r\n反垄断的\r\n/ˈæntiˈtrʌst/\r\n\r\n\r\nchancellor\r\n总理；大臣\r\n/ˈtʃɑːnsələ(r)/\r\n\r\n\r\nfrenzy\r\n狂热\r\n/ˈfrenzi/\r\n\r\n\r\nblurt\r\n脱口而出\r\n/ˈblɜːt/\r\n\r\n\r\naddled\r\n糊涂的\r\n/ˈædld/\r\n\r\n\r\nundermine\r\n破坏\r\n/ˈʌndəˈmaɪn/\r\n\r\n\r\nbribe\r\n贿赂\r\n/ˈbraɪb/\r\n\r\n\r\nalliance\r\n联盟\r\n/ˈælaɪəns/\r\n\r\n\r\nironically\r\n讽刺地\r\n/aɪˈrɒnɪkli/\r\n\r\n\r\nsovereignty\r\n主权\r\n/ˈsɒvrənti/\r\n\r\n\r\ncrunch\r\n嘎吱作响；关键时刻\r\n/ˈkrʌntʃ/\r\n\r\n\r\nimminent\r\n即将来临的\r\n/ˈɪmɪnənt/\r\n\r\n\r\ntellingly\r\n有效地；显著地\r\n/ˈtelɪŋli/\r\n\r\n\r\nreprisals\r\n报复\r\n/ˈreprɪzlz/\r\n\r\n\r\ntroll\r\n网络喷子\r\n/ˈtrəʊl/\r\n\r\n\r\nraft\r\n大量\r\n/ˈrɑːft/\r\n\r\n\r\nan electoral Las Vegas\r\n常被用来形容一些充满变数、热闹且带有投机性质的场景\r\n/ˈæn ɪˈlektərəl ˈlæz ˈveɪɡəs/\r\n\r\n\r\ncowardice\r\n懦弱\r\n/ˈkaʊədɪs/\r\n\r\n\r\nviral\r\n病毒式的\r\n/ˈvaɪrəl/\r\n\r\n\r\ntweet\r\n推文\r\n/ˈtwiːt/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","dateCreated":"2025-03-13T10:20:02+08:00","dateModified":"2025-08-31T10:48:02+08:00","datePublished":"2025-03-13T10:20:02+08:00","description":"","headline":"CAN EUROPE STOP ELON MUSK?","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://hydrogen1222.xyz/2025/03/13/Stormy%20English/The%20Atlantic/March/CAN%20EUROPE%20STOP%20ELON%20MUSK/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"John Doe","sameAs":["https://github.com/hydrogen1222","https://user.qzone.qq.com/2170147489/infocenter"],"image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59bc94fdda371da7bfe585b96a3463b0","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59bc94fdda371da7bfe585b96a3463b0"}},"url":"https://hydrogen1222.xyz/2025/03/13/Stormy%20English/The%20Atlantic/March/CAN%20EUROPE%20STOP%20ELON%20MUSK/","keywords":"English Learning"}</script>

<p>During an American election, a rich man can hand out $1 million
checks to prospective voters. Companies and people can use secretly
funded “dark money” nonprofits to donate unlimited money, anonymously,
to super PACs, which can then spend it on advertising campaigns.
Podcasters, partisans, or anyone, really, can tell outrageous,
incendiary lies about a candidate. They can boost those
<em>==falsehoods==</em> through targeted online advertising. No special
courts or election rules can stop the <em>==disinformation==</em> from
spreading before voters see it. The court of public opinion, which over
the past decade has seen and heard everything, no longer cares. U.S.
elections are now a political Las Vegas: Anything goes.</p>
<p>But that’s not the way elections are run in other countries. In
Britain, political parties are, at least during the run-up to an
election, limited to spending no more than £54,010 per candidate. In
Germany, as in many other European countries, the state funds political
parties, <em>==proportionate==</em> to their number of elected
<em>==parliamentarians==</em> , so that politicians do not have to
depend on, and become <em>==corrupted==</em> by, wealthy donors. In
Poland, courts <em>==fast-track==</em> election-related libel cases in
the weeks before a vote in order to discourage people from lying.</p>
<p>Nor is this unique to Europe. Many democracies have state or public
media that are obligated, at least in principle, to give equal time to
all sides. Many require political donations to be transparent, with the
names of donors listed in an online registry. Many have limits on
political advertising. Some countries also have rules about hate speech
and indict people who break them.</p>
<p>Countries apply these laws to create conditions for fair debate, to
build trust in the system, and to inspire confidence in the winning
candidates. Some democracies believe that transparency matters—that
voters should know who is funding their candidates, as well as who is
paying for political messages on social media or anywhere else. In some
places, these rules have <em>==a loftier goal==</em> : to prevent the
rise of anti democratic <em>==extremism==</em> of the kind that has
<em>==engulfed==</em> democracies— and especially European democracies—
in the past.</p>
<p>But for how much longer can democracies pursue these goals? We live
in a world in which <em>==algorithms==</em> controlled by American and
Chinese <em>==oligarchs==</em> choose the messages and images seen by
millions of people; in which money can move through secret bank accounts
with the help of <em>==crypto==</em> schemes; and in which this dark
money can then boost anonymous social-media accounts with the aim of
shaping public opinion. In such a world, how can any election rules be
enforced? If you are <em>==Albania==</em> , or even the United Kingdom,
do you still get to set the parameters of your public debate? Or are you
now forced to be Las Vegas too?</p>
<p><strong>ALTHOUGH IT’S EASY</strong> to get distracted by the
schoolyard nicknames and <em>==irresponsible==</em>
<em>==pedophilia==</em> accusations that Elon Musk <em>==flings==</em>
around, these are the real questions posed by his open, aggressive use
of X to spread false information and promote extremist and anti-European
politicians in the U.K., Germany, and elsewhere. The integrity of
elections— and the possibility of debate <em>==untainted==</em> by
misinformation injected from abroad—is equally challenged by TikTok, the
Chinese platform, and by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, whose
<em>==subsidiaries==</em> include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and
threads. TikTok says the company does not accept any paid political
advertising. Meta, which announced in January that it is abandoning
<em>==fact-checking==</em> on its sites in the U.S., also says it will
continue to comply with European laws. But even before Zucker berg’s
radical policy change, these promises were empty. Meta’s
<em>==vaunted==</em> content <em>==curation==</em> and moderation have
never been transparent. Nobody knew, and nobody knows, what exactly
Facebook’s algorithm was promoting and why. Even an occasional user of
these platforms encounters <em>==spammers==</em> , <em>==scammers==</em>
, and <em>==opaque==</em> accounts running foreign influence operations.
No guide to the algorithm, and no real choices about it, are available
on Meta products, X, or TikTok.</p>
<p>In truth, no one knows if any platforms really comply with
political-funding rules either, because nobody outside the companies can
fully monitor what happens online during an intense election
campaign—and after the voting has ended, it’s too late. According to
<em>==declassified==</em> Romanian-intelligence documents, someone
allegedly spent more than $1 million on TikTok content in the 18 months
before an election in support of a Romanian presidential candidate who
declared that he himself had spent nothing at all. In a belated attempt
to address this and other alleged discrepancies, a Romanian court
canceled the first round of that election, a decision that itself
damaged Romanian democracy.</p>
<p>Not all of this is new. <em>==Surreptitious==</em> political-party
funding was a feature of the Cold War, and the Russian government has
continued this practice, sometimes by offering deals to foreign
businesspeople close to pro-Russian politicians. Press moguls with
international political ambitions are hardly a <em>==novelty==</em> .
Rupert Murdoch, an Australian who has U.S. <em>==citizenship==</em> ,
has long played an outsize role in U.K. politics through his media
companies. John Major, the former British prime minister and
Conservative Party leader, has said that in 1997, Murdoch threatened to
pull his newspapers’ support unless the prime minister pursued a more
anti-European policy. Major refused. Murdoch has said, “I have never
asked a prime minister for anything,” but one of his Conservativeleaning
<em>==tabloids==</em> , <em>the Sun</em>, did endorse the Labour Party
in the next election. Major lost.</p>
<p>That incident now seems almost <em>==quaint==</em> . Even at the
height of its influence, the print edition of <em>the Sun</em> sold 4
million copies a day. More to the point, it operated, and still does,
within the <em>==constraints==</em> of U.K. rules and regulations, as do
all broadcast and print media. Murdoch’s newspapers take British
<em>==libel==</em> and <em>==hatespeech==</em> laws into consideration
when they run stories. His business strategy is necessarily shaped by
rules limiting what a single company can own. After his journalists were
accused of hacking phones and bribing police in the early 2000s, Murdoch
himself had to testify before an investigative commission, and he closed
down one of his tabloids for good.</p>
<p>Social media not only has far greater reach—Musk’s personal X account
has more than 212 million followers, giving him enormous power to set
the news agenda around the world— <em>==it also exists outside the legal
system==</em> . Under the American law known as Section 230, passed
nearly three decades ago, internet platforms are not treated as
publishers in the U.S. In practice, neither Facebook nor X has the same
legal responsibility for what appears on their platforms as do, say,
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and CNN. And this, too, has
consequences: Americans have created the information climate that other
countries must accept, and this allows <em>==deceptive==</em> election
practices to thrive. If countries don’t have their own laws, and until
recently most did not, Section 230 <em>==effectively==</em> requires
them to treat social-media companies as if they exist outside their
legal systems too.</p>
<p>Brazil broke with this pattern last year, when a judge demanded that
Musk comply with Brazilian laws against spreading misinformation and
political extremism, and forced X offline until he did. Several European
countries, including the U.K., Germany, and France, have also passed
laws designed to bring the platforms into compliance with their own
legal systems, mandating fines for companies that violate hatespeech
laws or host other illegal content. But these laws are controversial and
hard to enforce. Besides, “illegal speech” is not necessarily the
central problem. No laws prevented Musk from interviewing Alice Weidel,
a leader of the <em>==far-right==</em> Alternative for Germany (AfD)
party, on X, thereby providing her with a huge platform, available to no
other political candidate, in the month before a national election. the
interview, which included several <em>==glaringly==</em> false
statements (among others, that Weidel was the “leading” candidate), was
viewed 45 million times in 24 hours, a number far beyond the reach of
any German public or private media.</p>
<p><strong>ONLY ON INSTITUTION</strong> on the planet is large enough
and powerful enough to write and enforce laws that could make the tech
companies change their policies. Partly for that reason, the European
Union may soon become one of the Trump administration’s most
<em>==prominent==</em> targets. In theory, the EU’s Digital Services
Act, which <em>==took full effect==</em> last year, can be used to
regulate, fine, and, in extreme circumstances, ban internet companies
whose practices <em>==clash with==</em> European laws. Yet a primary
<em>==intent==</em> of the act is not <em>==punitive==</em> , but rather
to open up the platforms: to allow <em>==vetted==</em> researchers
access to platform data, and to give citizens more transparency about
what they hear and see. Freedom of speech also means the right to
receive information, and at the moment social-media companies operate
behind a curtain. We don’t know if they are promoting or suppressing
certain points of view, <em>==curbing==</em> or encouraging
<em>==orchestrated==</em> political campaigns, discouraging or provoking
violent riots. Above all, we don’t know who is paying for misinformation
to be spread online.</p>
<p>In the past, the EU has not hesitated to try to apply European law to
tech companies. Over the past decade, for example, Google has faced
three fines totaling more than $8 billion for breaking antitrust law
(though one of these fines was <em>==overturned==</em> by the EU’s
General Court in 2024).</p>
<p>In November, the European Commission ned Meta more than $800 million
for unfair trade practices. But for how much longer will the EU have
this authority? In the fall, J. D. Vance issued an extraordinarily
<em>==unsubtle==</em> threat, one that is frequently repeated in Europe.
“If NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to
continue to be a good participant in this military alliance,” Vance told
an interviewer, “why don’t you respect American values and respect free
speech?” Mark Zuckerberg, echoing Vance’s <em>==misuse==</em> of the
expression free speech to mean “freedom to conceal company practices
from the public,” put it even more <em>==crudely==</em> . In a
conversation with Joe Rogan in January, Zuckerberg said he feels
“optimistic” that President Donald Trump will intervene to stop the EU
from enforcing its own <em>==antitrust==</em> laws: “I think he just
wants America to win.”</p>
<p>Does America “winning” mean that European democracies, and maybe
other democracies, lose? Some European politicians think it might.
Robert Habeck, the German vice <em>==chancellor==</em> and a leader of
that country’s Green Party,</p>
<p>believes that Musk’s <em>==frenzies==</em> of political activity on X
aren’t the random <em>==blurts==</em> of an <em>==addled==</em> mind,
but rather are “logical and systematic.” In his New Year’s address,
Habeck said that Musk is deliberately “strengthening those who are
weakening Europe,” including the explicitly anti-European AfD. This, he
believes, is because “a weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom
regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power.”</p>
<p>Until recently, Russia was the most important state seeking to
<em>==undermine==</em> European institutions. Vladimir Putin has long
disliked the EU because it restricts Russian companies’ ability to
intimidate and <em>==bribe==</em> European political leaders and
companies, and because the EU is larger and more powerful than Russia,
whereas European countries on their own are not. Now a group of American
oligarchs also want to undermine European institutions, because they
don’t want to be regulated—and they may have the American president on
their side. Quite soon, the European Union, along with Great Britain and
other democracies around the world, might find that they have to choose
between their <em>==alliance==</em> with the United States and their
ability to run their own elections and select their own leaders without
the pressure of aggressive outside manipulation. <em>==Ironically==</em>
, countries, such as Brazil, that don’t have the same deep military,
economic, and cultural ties to the U.S. may and it easier to maintain
the <em>==sovereignty==</em> of their political systems and the
transparency of their information ecosystems than Europeans.</p>
<p>A <em>==crunch==</em> point is <em>==imminent==</em> , when the
European Commission finally concludes a year-long investigation into X.
<em>==Tellingly==</em> , two people who have advised the commission on
this investigation would talk with me only off the record, because the
potential for <em>==reprisals==</em> against them and their
organizations— whether it be online <em>==trolling==</em> and harassment
or lawsuits— is too great. Still, both advisers said that the commission
has the power to protect Europe’s sovereignty, and to force the
platforms to be more transparent. “¦e commission should look at the
<em>==raft==</em> of laws and rules it has available and see how they
can be applied,” one of them told me, “always remembering that this is
not about taking action against a person’s voice. ¦is is the commission
saying that everyone’s voice should be equal.”</p>
<p>At least in theory, no country is obligated to become <em>==an
electoral Las Vegas==</em> , as America has. Global democracies could
demand greater transparency around the use of algorithms, both on social
media and in the online-advertising market more broadly. ¦ey could other
consumers more control over what they see, and more information about
what they don’t see. ¦ey could enforce their own campaign-funding laws.
These changes could make the internet more open and fair, and therefore
a better, safer place for the exercise of free speech. If the chances of
success seem narrow, it’s not because of the lack of a viable legal
framework— rather it’s because, at the moment, <em>==cowardice==</em> is
as <em>==viral==</em> as one of Musk’s <em>==tweets==</em> .</p>
